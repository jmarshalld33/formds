Senior Informatics Project 

We built this web application to complete a senior project for the University of Washington's Informatics degree. We teamed up with BlackRock, a fiduciary ho sells investment services. Our project was to gather competitor data from the Securities and Exchange Commissions' website then aggregate the data onto a website. We built
scripts to collect data then allowed users to query, search and filter data. We used Python, Ruby, SQL, HTML, CSS and Javascript. We utilized Flask, XBRLware, Arelle, SQLite, jQuery, Google Charts, Bootstrap and Git. We built the data model and the relational tables. We met with BlackRock employees regularly to translate business requirements into technical tasks. We conducted usability studies and followed Agile development. We handed off our work to BlackRock upon graduating and they will continue to develop what we started.
