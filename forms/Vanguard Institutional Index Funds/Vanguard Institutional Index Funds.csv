These examples assume that the Shares provide a return of 5% a year and that total annual fund operating expenses remain as stated in the preceding table.

Investment objective,v_Institutional_S000002853,,,,,<p>The Fund seeks to track the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of large-capitalization stocks.</p>
Performance Table Closing,v_Institutional_S000002853,,,,,"<p>Actual after-tax returns depend on your tax situation and may differ from those shown in the preceding table.

After-tax returns are not relevant for a shareholder who holds fund shares in a tax-deferred account, such as an individual retirement account or a 401(k) plan.

You should expect the Fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The Fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the Fund's performance:</p><p>Stock market risk, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The Fund's target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies, which could cause the Fund to underperform the overall stock market.</p><p>Investment style risk, which is the chance that returns from large-capitalization stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Large-cap stocks tend to go through cycles of doing better-or worse-than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years.</p><p>An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.</p>"
