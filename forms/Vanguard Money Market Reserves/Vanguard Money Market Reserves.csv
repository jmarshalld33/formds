Bar Chart Narrative,v_Retail_S000004463,,,,,"<p>The following bar chart and table are intended to help you understand the risks of investing in the Fund. The bar chart shows how the performance of the Fund's Investor Shares has varied from one calendar year to another over the periods shown.

"Expense Example, Narrative [Text Block]",v_Retail_S000004463,,,,,"<p>The following example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund's Investor Shares with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. It illustrates the hypothetical expenses that you would incur over various periods if you invest $10,000 in the Fund's shares. This example assumes that the Shares provide a return of 5% a year and that total annual fund operating expenses remain as stated in the preceding table. The results apply whether or not you redeem your investment at the end of the given period. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:</p>"
Fees and Expenses of the Fund,v_Retail_S000004463,,,,,<p>The following table describes the fees and expenses you may pay if you buy and hold Investor Shares of the Fund.</p>
Investment objective,v_Retail_S000004463,,,,,<p>The Fund seeks to provide current income while maintaining liquidity and a stable share price of $1.</p>
Risk Narrative,v_Retail_S000004463,,,,,"<p>The Fund is designed for investors with a low tolerance for risk; however, the Fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the Fund's performance:</p><p>Income risk, which is the chance that the Fund's income will decline because of falling interest rates. Because the Fund's income is based on short-term interest rates-which can fluctuate significantly over short periods-income risk is expected to be high.</p><p>Manager risk, which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the Fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective. </p><p>Credit risk, which is the chance that the issuer of a security will fail to pay interest and principal in a timely manner, or that negative perceptions of the issuer's ability to make such payments will cause the price of that security to decline. Credit risk should be very low for the Fund because it invests primarily in securities that are considered to be of high quality.</p><p>Industry concentration risk, which is the chance that there will be overall problems affecting a particular industry. Because the Fund invests more than 25% of its assets in securities issued by companies in the financial services industry, the Fund's performance depends to a greater extent on the overall condition of that industry.</p><p>An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the Fund.</p>"
StrategyNarrative,v_Retail_S000004463,,,,,"<p>The Fund invests primarily in high-quality, short-term money market instruments, including certificates of deposit, banker's acceptances, commercial paper, and other money market securities. To be considered high-quality, a security generally must be rated in one of the two highest credit-quality categories for short-term securities by at least two nationally recognized rating services (or by one, if only one rating service has rated the security). If unrated, the security must be determined by Vanguard to be of quality equivalent to securities in the two highest credit-quality categories. The Fund invests more than 25% of its assets in securities issued by companies in the financial services industry. The Fund maintains a dollar-weighted average maturity of 60 days or less and a dollar-weighted average life of 120 days or less.</p>"
