Strategy Narrative [Text Block],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000002520_MemberBlackrock_Member,,,,,"The Fund will seek to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio consisting primarily of common stock of U.S. companies that Fund management believes have exhibited above-average growth rates in earnings over the long term. In other words, Fund management tries to choose investments that will increase in value over the long term.<br/><br/>The Fund will generally invest at least 65% of its total assets in the following equity securities:<ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left: -20px"">Common stock;</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left: -20px"">Convertible preferred stock;</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left: -20px"">Securities convertible into common stock; and</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left: -20px"">Rights to subscribe to common stock.</li></ul>Of these securities the Fund generally seeks to invest primarily in common stock.<br/><br/>The Fund may invest in companies of any size but emphasizes investments in companies that have medium to large stock market capitalizations (currently, approximately $2 billion or more).<br/><br/>Convertible securities generally are debt securities or preferred stock that may be converted into common stock. Convertible securities typically pay current income as either interest (debt security convertibles) or dividends (preferred stock). A convertible&#8217;s value usually reflects both the stream of current income payments and the market value of the underlying common stock. The Fund may purchase securities pursuant to the exercise of subscription rights, which allow an issuer&#8217;s existing shareholders to purchase additional common stock at a price substantially below the market price of the shares."
Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000002520_MemberBlackrock_Member,,,,,"Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in the Fund, as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment, may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. The following is a summary description of principal risks of investing in the Fund.<ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left: -20px""><b>Convertible Securities Risk &#8212;</b> The market value of a convertible security performs like that of a regular debt security; that is, if market interest rates rise, the value of a convertible security usually falls. In addition, convertible securities are subject to the risk that the issuer will not be able to pay interest or dividends when due, and their market value may change based on changes in the issuer&#8217;s credit rating or the market&#8217;s perception of the issuer&#8217;s creditworthiness. Since it derives a portion of its value from the common stock into which it may be converted, a convertible security is also subject to the same types of market and issuer risks that apply to the underlying common stock.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left: -20px""><b>Equity Securities Risk &#8212;</b> Stock markets are volatile. The price of equity securities fluctuates based on changes in a company&#8217;s financial condition and overall market and economic conditions.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left: -20px""><b>Investment Style Risk &#8212; </b>  Under certain market conditions, growth investments have performed better during the later stages of economic expansion. Therefore, this investment style may over time go in and out of favor. At times when the investment style used by the Fund is out of favor, the Fund may underperform other equity funds that use different investment styles.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left: -20px""><b>Market Risk and Selection Risk &#8212; </b>  Market risk is the risk that one or more markets in which the Fund invests will go down in value, including the possibility that the markets will go down sharply and unpredictably. Selection risk is the risk that the securities selected by Fund management will underperform the markets, the relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds with similar investment objectives and investment strategies. This means you may lose money.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left: -20px""><b>Mid Cap Securities Risk </b> &#8212; The securities of mid cap companies generally trade in lower volumes and are generally subject to greater and less predictable price changes than the securities of larger capitalization companies.</li></ul>"

Effective June 28, 2010, the Fund reorganized with the BlackRock Capital Appreciation Portfolio (the &#8220;Predecessor Fund&#8221;), a series of BlackRock Funds<sup>SM</sup> (the &#8220;Reorganization&#8221;), and the Predecessor Fund&#8217;s performance and financial history has been adopted by the Fund from the date of the Reorganization. The performance of BlackRock Shares of the Fund is based off of the performance of Institutional Shares of the Predecessor Fund, with no adjustments. On January 31, 2005, the Predecessor Fund reorganized with the State Street Research Legacy Fund (the &#8220;SSR Fund&#8221;), which had investment goals and strategies substantially similar to the Fund. For periods prior to January 31, 2005, the chart and table show performance information for the SSR Fund. The table compares the Fund&#8217;s performance to that of the Russell 1000<sup>&#174;</sup> Growth Index and the S&P 500<sup>&#174;</sup> Index, which are relevant to the Fund because they have characteristics similar to the Fund&#8217;s investment strategy. As with all such investments, past performance (before and after taxes) is not an indication of future results. If the Fund&#8217;s investment manager and its affiliates had not waived or reimbursed certain Fund expenses during these periods, the Fund&#8217;s returns would have been lower.

Effective June 28, 2010, the Fund reorganized with the BlackRock Capital Appreciation Portfolio (the &#8220;Predecessor Fund&#8221;), a series of BlackRock Funds<sup>SM</sup> (the &#8220;Reorganization&#8221;), and the Predecessor Fund&#8217;s performance and financial history has been adopted by the Fund from the date of the Reorganization. The performance of Investor A, Investor B and Investor C Shares of the Fund is based off of the performance of those same share classes of the Predecessor Fund, with no adjustments. The performance of Class R and Institutional Shares of the Fund, is based off of the performance of Institutional Shares of the Predecessor Fund, adjusted to reflect the distribution and service (12b-1 fees) and other fees, if any, that are applicable to such class of shares. On January 31, 2005, the Predecessor Fund reorganized with the State Street Research Legacy Fund (the &#8220;SSR Fund&#8221;), which had investment goals and strategies substantially similar to the Fund. For periods prior to January 31, 2005, the chart and table show performance information for the SSR Fund. The table compares the Fund&#8217;s performance to that of the Russell 1000<sup>&#174;</sup> Growth Index and the S&P 500<sup>&#174;</sup> Index, which are relevant to the Fund because they have characteristics similar to the Fund&#8217;s investment strategy. As with all such investments, past performance (before and after taxes) is not an indication of future results. Sales charges are not reflected in the bar chart. If they were, returns would be less than those shown. However, the table includes all applicable fees and sales charges. If the Fund&#8217;s investment manager and its affiliates had not waived or reimbursed certain Fund expenses during these periods, the Fund&#8217;s returns would have been lower. Updated information on the Fund&#8217;s performance can be obtained by visiting http://www.blackrock.com/funds or can be obtained by phone at (800) 882-0052."

Strategy Narrative [Text Block],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000002520_MemberInvestorInstitutionalAndClassRShares_Member,,,,,"The Fund will seek to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio consisting primarily of common stock of U.S. companies that Fund management believes have exhibited above-average growth rates in earnings over the long term. In other words, Fund management tries to choose investments that will increase in value over the long term.<br /><br />The Fund will generally invest at least 65% of its total assets in the following equity securities:<ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left: -20px"">Common stock;</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left: -20px"">Convertible preferred stock;</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left: -20px"">Securities convertible into common stock; and</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left: -20px"">Rights to subscribe to common stock.</li></ul>Of these securities the Fund generally seeks to invest primarily in common stock.<br /><br />The Fund may invest in companies of any size but emphasizes investments in companies that have medium to large stock market capitalizations (currently, approximately $2 billion or more).<br /><br />Convertible securities generally are debt securities or preferred stock that may be converted into common stock. Convertible securities typically pay current income as either interest (debt security convertibles) or dividends (preferred stock). A convertible&#8217;s value usually reflects both the stream of current income payments and the market value of the underlying common stock. The Fund may purchase securities pursuant to the exercise of subscription rights, which allow an issuer&#8217;s existing shareholders to purchase additional common stock at a price substantially below the market price of the shares."
Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000002520_MemberInvestorInstitutionalAndClassRShares_Member,,,,,"Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in the Fund, as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment, may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. The following is a summary description of principal risks of investing in the Fund.<ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left: -20px""><b>Convertible Securities Risk</b> &#8212; The market value of a convertible security performs like that of a regular debt security; that is, if market interest rates rise, the value of a convertible security usually falls. In addition, convertible securities are subject to the risk that the issuer will not be able to pay interest or dividends when due, and their market value may change based on changes in the issuer&#8217;s credit rating or the market&#8217;s perception of the issuer&#8217;s creditworthiness. Since it derives a portion of its value from the common stock into which it may be converted, a convertible security is also subject to the same types of market and issuer risks that apply to the underlying common stock.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left: -20px""><b>Equity Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Stock markets are volatile. The price of equity securities fluctuates based on changes in a company&#8217;s financial condition and overall market and economic conditions.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left: -20px""><b>Investment Style Risk</b> &#8212; Under certain market conditions, growth investments have performed better during the later stages of economic expansion. Therefore, this investment style may over time go in and out of favor. At times when the investment style used by the Fund is out of favor, the Fund may underperform other equity funds that use different investment styles.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left: -20px""><b>Market Risk and Selection Risk</b> &#8212; Market risk is the risk that one or more markets in which the Fund invests will go down in value, including the possibility that the markets will go down sharply and unpredictably. Selection risk is the risk that the securities selected by Fund management will underperform the markets, the relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds with similar investment objectives and investment strategies. This means you may lose money.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left: -20px""><b>Mid Cap Securities Risk</b> &#8212; The securities of mid cap companies generally trade in lower volumes and are generally subject to greater and less predictable price changes than the securities of larger capitalization companies.</li></ul>"
