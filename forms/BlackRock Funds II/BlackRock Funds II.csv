The Fund invests primarily in securities issued by the GNMA as well as other U.S. Government securities in the five to ten year maturity range. <br /><br />Securities purchased by the Fund are rated in the highest rating category (AAA or Aaa) at the time of purchase by at least one major rating agency or are determined by the Fund management team to be of similar quality. Split rated bonds will be considered to have the higher credit rating. Split rated bonds are bonds that receive different ratings from two or more rating agencies. <br /><br />The Fund measures its performance against the Barclays GNMA MBS Index (the benchmark). The Fund management team will normally attempt to structure the Fund&#8217;s portfolio to have comparable duration to its benchmark. <br /><br />The Fund also makes investments in residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and other asset-backed securities. <br /><br />The Fund may buy or sell options or futures on a security or an index of securities, or enter into credit default swaps and interest rate transactions, including swaps (collectively, commonly known as derivatives). The Fund may seek to obtain market exposure to the securities in which it primarily invests by entering into a series of purchase and sale contracts or by using other investment techniques (such as reverse repurchase agreements or dollar rolls). <br /><br />The Fund may engage in active and frequent trading of portfolio securities to achieve its primary investment strategies."

Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000018378_MemberInvestorAndInstitutional_Member,,,,,"Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in the Fund, as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment, may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. The following is a summary description of principal risks of investing in the Fund. <br /> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Credit Risk</b> &#8212; Credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of a security will not be able to make payments of interest and principal when due. Changes in an issuer&#8217;s credit rating or the market&#8217;s perception of an issuer&#8217;s creditworthiness may also affect the value of the Fund&#8217;s investment in that issuer.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Derivatives Risk</b> &#8212; The Fund&#8217;s use of derivatives may reduce the Fund&#8217;s returns and/or increase volatility. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, an index or a market to fluctuate significantly in price within a short time period. Derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction  will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund&#8217;s use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the overall securities markets. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund to value accurately. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Recent legislation calls for new regulation of the derivatives markets. The extent and impact of the regulation is not yet known and may not be known for some time. New regulation may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, or may otherwise adversely affect the value or performance of derivatives. </li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Dollar Rolls Risk</b> &#8212; Dollar rolls involve the risk that the market value of the securities that the Fund is committed to buy may decline below the price of the securities the Fund has sold. These transactions may involve leverage.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Extension Risk</b> &#8212; When interest rates rise, certain obligations will be paid off by the obligor more slowly than anticipated, causing the value of these securities to fall.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>High Portfolio Turnover Risk</b> &#8212; The Fund may engage in active and frequent trading of its portfolio securities. High portfolio turnover (more than 100%) may result in increased transaction costs to the Fund, including brokerage commissions, dealer mark-ups and other transaction costs on the sale of the securities and on reinvestment in other securities. The sale of Fund portfolio securities may result in the realization and/or distribution to shareholders of higher capital gains or losses as compared to a fund with less active trading policies. These effects of higher than normal portfolio turnover may adversely affect Fund performance. In addition, investment in mortgage dollar rolls and participation in TBA transactions may significantly increase the Fund&#8217;s portfolio turnover rate. A TBA transaction is a method of trading mortgage-backed securities where the buyer and seller agree upon general trade parameters such as agency, settlement date, par amount, and price.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Interest Rate Risk</b> &#8212; Interest rate risk is the risk that prices of bonds and other fixed-income securities will increase as interest rates fall, and decrease as interest rates rise.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Leverage Risk</b> &#8212; Some transactions may give rise to a form of economic leverage. These transactions may include, among others, derivatives, and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. The use of leverage may cause the Fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations or to meet any required asset segregation requirements. Increases and decreases in the value of the Fund&#8217;s portfolio will be magnified when the Fund uses leverage.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Liquidity Risk</b> &#8212; Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell. The Fund&#8217;s investments in illiquid securities may reduce the returns of the Fund because it may be difficult to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. To the extent that the Fund&#8217;s principal investment strategies involve derivatives or securities with substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have the greatest exposure to liquidity risk. Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, particularly during periods of market turmoil. Illiquid investments may be harder to value, especially in changing markets, and if the Fund is forced to sell these investments to meet redemption requests or for other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss. In addition, when there is illiquidity in the market for certain securities, the Fund, due to limitations on illiquid investments, may be subject to purchase and sale restrictions.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Market Risk and Selection Risk</b> &#8212; Market risk is the risk that one or more markets in which the Fund invests will go down in value, including the possibility that the markets will go down sharply and unpredictably. Selection risk is the risk that the securities selected by Fund management will underperform the markets, the relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds with similar investment objectives and investment strategies. This means you may lose money.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securities Risks</b> &#8212; Mortgage- and asset-backed securities represent interests in &#8220;pools&#8221; of mortgages or other assets, including consumer loans or receivables held in trust. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are subject to credit, interest rate, prepayment and extension risks. These securities also are subject to risk of default on the underlying mortgage or asset, particularly during periods of economic downturn. Small movements in interest rates (both increases and decreases) may quickly and significantly reduce the value of certain mortgage-backed securities.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Prepayment Risk</b> &#8212; When interest rates fall, certain obligations will be paid off by the obligor more quickly than originally anticipated, and the Fund may have to invest the proceeds in securities with lower yields.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Repurchase Agreements, Purchase and Sale Contracts Risks</b> &#8212; If the other party to a repurchase agreement or purchase and sale contract defaults on its obligation under the agreement, the Fund may suffer delays and incur costs or lose money in exercising its rights under the agreement. If the seller fails to repurchase the security in either situation and the market value of the security declines, the Fund may lose money.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Reverse Repurchase Agreements Risk</b> &#8212; Reverse repurchase agreements involve the sale of securities held by the Fund with an agreement to repurchase the securities at an agreed-upon price, date and interest payment. Reverse repurchase agreements involve the risk that the other party may fail to return the securities in a timely manner or at  all. The Fund could lose money if it is unable to recover the securities and the value of the collateral held by the Fund, including the value of the investments made with cash collateral, is less than the value of securities. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences to the Fund.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>U.S. Government Issuer Risk</b> &#8212; Treasury obligations may differ in their interest rates, maturities, times of issuance and other characteristics. Obligations of U.S. Government agencies and authorities are supported by varying degrees of credit but generally are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. No assurance can be given that the U.S. Government will provide financial support to its agencies and authorities if it is not obligated by law to do so.</li></ul>"

Risk/Return [Heading],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000018378_MemberInvestorAndInstitutional_Member,,,,,Fund Overview<br /><br /><b>Key Facts about BlackRock GNMA Portfolio</b>
Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000018352_MemberInvestorAndInstitutional_Member,,,,,"Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in the Fund, as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment, may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. The following is a summary description of principal risks of investing in the Fund. <br /> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Credit Risk &#8212; </b>Credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of a security will not be able to make payments of interest and principal when due. Changes in an issuer&#8217;s credit rating or the market&#8217;s perception of an issuer&#8217;s creditworthiness may also affect the value of the Fund&#8217;s investment in that issuer.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Deflation Risk &#8212; </b>Deflation risk is the possibility that prices throughout the economy decline over time &#8212; the opposite of inflation. If inflation is negative, the principal and income of an inflation-protected bond will decline and could result in losses for the Fund.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Derivatives Risk &#8212; </b>The Fund's use of derivatives may reduce the Fund's returns and/or increase volatility. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, an index or a market to fluctuate significantly in price within a short time period. Derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund's use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the overall securities markets. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund to value accurately. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Recent legislation calls for new regulation of the derivatives markets. The extent and impact of the regulation is not yet known and may not be known for some time. New regulation may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, or may otherwise adversely affect the value or performance of derivatives.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Dollar Rolls Risk &#8212; </b>Dollar rolls involve the risk that the market value of the securities that the Fund is committed to buy may decline below the price of the securities the Fund has sold. These transactions may involve leverage.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Emerging Markets Risk &#8212; </b>Emerging markets are riskier than more developed markets because they tend to develop unevenly and may never fully develop. Investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative. Emerging markets are more likely to experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations, which adversely affect returns to U.S. investors.

High portfolio turnover (more than 100%) may result in increased transaction costs to the Fund, including brokerage commissions, dealer mark-ups and other transaction costs on the sale of the securities and on reinvestment in other securities. The sale of Fund portfolio securities may result in the realization and/or distribution to shareholders of higher capital gains or losses as compared to a fund with less active trading policies. These effects of higher than normal portfolio turnover may adversely affect Fund performance. In addition, investment in mortgage dollar rolls and participation in TBA transactions may significantly increase the Fund's portfolio turnover rate. A TBA transaction is a method of trading mortgage-backed securities where the buyer and seller agree upon general trade parameters such as agency, settlement date, par amount, and price.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Inflation Indexed Bonds &#8212; </b>The principal value of an investment is not protected or otherwise guaranteed by virtue of the Fund's investments in inflation-indexed bonds.<br/><br/> Inflation-indexed bonds are fixed-income securities whose principal value is periodically adjusted according to the rate of inflation. If the index measuring inflation falls, the principal value of inflation-indexed bonds will be adjusted downward, and consequently the interest payable on these securities (calculated with respect to a smaller principal amount) will be reduced.</li></ul>Repayment of the original bond principal upon maturity (as adjusted for inflation) is guaranteed in the case of U.S. Treasury inflation-indexed bonds. For bonds that do not provide a similar guarantee, the adjusted principal value of the bond repaid at maturity may be less than the original principal value.<br/><br/>The value of inflation-indexed bonds is expected to change in response to changes in real interest rates. Real interest rates are tied to the relationship between nominal interest rates and the rate of inflation. If nominal interest rates increase at a faster rate than inflation, real interest rates may rise, leading to a decrease in value of inflation-indexed bonds. Short-term increases in inflation may lead to a decline in value. Any increase in the principal amount of an inflation-indexed bond will be considered taxable ordinary income, even though investors do not receive their principal until maturity.<br/><br/>Periodic adjustments for inflation to the principal amount of an inflation-indexed bond may give rise to original issue discount, which will be includable in the Fund's gross income. Due to original issue discount, the Fund may be required to make annual distributions to shareholders that exceed the cash received, which may cause the Fund to liquidate certain investments when it is not advantageous to do so. Also, if the principal value of an inflation-indexed bond is adjusted downward due to deflation, amounts previously distributed in the taxable year may be characterized in some circumstances as a return of capital.<ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Interest Rate Risk &#8212; </b>Interest rate risk is the risk that prices of bonds and other fixed-income securities will increase as interest rates fall, and decrease as interest rates rise.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Leverage Risk &#8212; </b>Some transactions may give rise to a form of economic leverage. These transactions may include, among others, derivatives, and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. The use of leverage may cause the Fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations or to meet any required asset segregation requirements. Increases and decreases in the value of the Fund's portfolio will be magnified when the Fund uses leverage.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Liquidity Risk &#8212; </b>Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell. The Fund's investments in illiquid securities may reduce the returns of the Fund because it may be difficult to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. To the extent that the Fund's principal investment strategies involve derivatives or securities with substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have the greatest exposure to liquidity risk. Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, particularly during periods of market turmoil. Illiquid investments may be harder to value, especially in changing markets, and if the Fund is forced to sell these investments to meet redemption requests or for other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss. In addition, when there is illiquidity in the market for certain securities, the Fund, due to limitations on illiquid investments, may be subject to purchase and sale restrictions.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Market Risk and Selection Risk &#8212; </b>Market risk is the risk that one or more markets in which the Fund invests will go down in value, including the possibility that the markets will go down sharply and unpredictably. Selection risk is the risk that the securities selected by Fund management will underperform the markets, the relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds with similar investment objectives and investment strategies. This means you may lose money.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securities Risks &#8212; </b>Mortgage- and asset-backed securities represent interests in ""pools"" of mortgages or other assets, including consumer loans or receivables held in trust. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are subject to credit, interest rate, prepayment and extension risks. These securities also are subject to risk of default on the underlying mortgage or asset, particularly during periods of economic downturn. Small movements in interest rates (both increases and decreases) may quickly and significantly reduce the value of certain mortgage-backed securities.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Non-Diversification Risk &#8212; </b>The Fund is a non-diversified fund. Because the Fund may invest in securities of a smaller number of issuers, it may be more exposed to the risks associated with and developments affecting an individual issuer than a fund that invests more widely.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Non-Investment Grade Securities Risk &#8212; </b>Although non-investment grade securities generally pay higher rates of interest than investment grade securities, non-investment grade securities are high risk investments that may cause income and principal losses for the Fund.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Prepayment Risk &#8212; </b>When interest rates fall, certain obligations will be paid off by the obligor more quickly than originally anticipated, and the Fund may have to invest the proceeds in securities with lower yields.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Repurchase Agreements, Purchase and Sale Contracts Risks &#8212; </b>If the other party to a repurchase agreement or purchase and sale contract defaults on its obligation under the agreement, the Fund may suffer delays and incur costs or lose money in exercising its rights under the agreement. If the seller fails to repurchase the security in either situation and the market value of the security declines, the Fund may lose money.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Reverse Repurchase Agreements Risk &#8212; </b>Reverse repurchase agreements involve the sale of securities held by the Fund with an agreement to repurchase the securities at an agreed-upon price, date and interest payment. Reverse repurchase agreements involve the risk that the other party may fail to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund could lose money if it is unable to recover the securities and the value of the collateral held by the Fund, including the value of the investments made with cash collateral, is less than the value of securities. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences to the Fund.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>U.S. Government Issuer Risk &#8212; </b>Treasury obligations may differ in their interest rates, maturities, times of issuance and other characteristics. Obligations of U.S. Government agencies and authorities are supported by varying degrees of credit but generally are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. No assurance can be given that the U.S. Government will provide financial support to its agencies and authorities if it is not obligated by law to do so.</li></ul>"

The Fund invests primarily in the highest rated government and agency bonds and maintains an average portfolio duration that is within &#177;20% of the Barclays U.S. Government/Mortgage Index (the benchmark).<br/><br/>Securities purchased by the Fund generally are rated in the highest rating category (AAA or Aaa) at the time of purchase by at least one major rating agency or are determined by the Fund management team to be of similar quality. In addition, the Fund&#8217;s dollar-weighted average maturity will be between 3 and 10 years. <br /><br />The Fund evaluates sectors of the bond market and individual securities within these sectors. The Fund selects bonds from several sectors including: U.S. Treasuries and agency securities, commercial and residential mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations (&#8220;CMOs&#8221;), asset-backed securities and corporate bonds. <br /><br/>The Fund invests primarily in dollar-denominated bonds, but may invest up to 10% of its assets in non-dollar denominated bonds of issuers located outside of the United States. The Fund&#8217;s investment in non-dollar denominated bonds may be on a currency hedged or unhedged basis. <br /><br />The Fund may buy or sell options or futures on a security or an index of securities, or enter into credit default swaps and interest rate or foreign currency transactions, including swaps (collectively, commonly known as derivatives). The Fund may seek to obtain market exposure to the securities in which it primarily invests by entering into a series of purchase and sale contracts or by using other investment techniques (such as reverse repurchase agreements or dollar rolls). <br /><br />The Fund may engage in active and frequent trading of portfolio securities to achieve its primary investment strategies."

Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000018378_MemberServiceShares_Member,,,,,"Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in the Fund, as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment, may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. The following is a summary description of principal risks of investing in the Fund. <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><p style=""PADDING-LEFT: 15px""><b> Credit Risk </b>&#8212; Credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of a security will not be able to make payments of interest and principal when due. Changes in an issuer&#8217;s credit rating or the market&#8217;s perception of an issuer&#8217;s creditworthiness may also affect the value of the Fund&#8217;s investment in that issuer.</p></li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><p style=""PADDING-LEFT: 15px""><b> Derivatives Risk </b>&#8212; The Fund&#8217;s use of derivatives may reduce the Fund&#8217;s returns and/or increase volatility. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, an index or a market to fluctuate significantly in price within a short time period. Derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund&#8217;s use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the overall securities markets. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund to value accurately. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Recent legislation calls for new regulation of the derivatives markets. The extent and impact of the regulation is not yet known and may not be known for some time. New regulation may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, or may otherwise adversely affect the value or performance of derivatives.</p></li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><p style=""PADDING-LEFT: 15px""><b> Dollar Rolls Risk </b>&#8212; Dollar rolls involve the risk that the market value of the securities that the Fund is committed to buy may decline below the price of the securities the Fund has sold. These transactions may involve leverage.</p></li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><p style=""PADDING-LEFT: 15px""><b> Extension Risk </b>&#8212; When interest rates rise, certain obligations will be paid off by the obligor more slowly than anticipated, causing the value of these securities to fall.</p></li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><p style=""PADDING-LEFT: 15px""><b> High Portfolio Turnover Risk </b>&#8212; The Fund may engage in active and frequent trading of its portfolio securities. High portfolio turnover (more than 100%) may result in increased transaction costs to the Fund, including brokerage commissions, dealer mark-ups and other transaction costs on the sale of the securities and on reinvestment in other securities. The sale of Fund portfolio securities may result in the realization and/or distribution to shareholders of higher capital gains or losses as compared to a fund with less active trading policies. These effects of higher than normal portfolio turnover may adversely affect Fund performance. In addition, investment in mortgage dollar rolls and participation in TBA transactions may significantly increase the Fund&#8217;s portfolio turnover rate. A TBA transaction is a method of trading mortgage-backed securities where the buyer and seller agree upon general trade parameters such as agency, settlement date, par amount, and price.</p></li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><p style=""PADDING-LEFT: 15px""><b> Interest Rate Risk </b>&#8212; Interest rate risk is the risk that prices of bonds and other fixed-income securities will increase as interest rates fall, and decrease as interest rates rise.</p></li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><p style=""PADDING-LEFT: 15px""><b> Leverage Risk </b>&#8212; Some transactions may give rise to a form of economic leverage. These transactions may include, among others, derivatives, and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. The use of leverage may cause the Fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations or  to meet any required asset segregation requirements. Increases and decreases in the value of the Fund&#8217;s portfolio will be magnified when the Fund uses leverage.</p></li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><p style=""PADDING-LEFT: 15px""><b> Liquidity Risk </b>&#8212; Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell. The Fund&#8217;s investments in illiquid securities may reduce the returns of the Fund because it may be difficult to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. To the extent that the Fund&#8217;s principal investment strategies involve derivatives or securities with substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have the greatest exposure to liquidity risk. Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, particularly during periods of market turmoil. Illiquid investments may be harder to value, especially in changing markets, and if the Fund is forced to sell these investments to meet redemption requests or for other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss. In addition, when there is illiquidity in the market for certain securities, the Fund, due to limitations on illiquid investments, may be subject to purchase and sale restrictions.</p></li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><p style=""PADDING-LEFT: 15px""><b> Market Risk and Selection Risk </b>&#8212; Market risk is the risk that one or more markets in which the Fund invests will go down in value, including the possibility that the markets will go down sharply and unpredictably. Selection risk is the risk that the securities selected by Fund management will underperform the markets, the relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds with similar investment objectives and investment strategies. This means you may lose money.</p></li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><p style=""PADDING-LEFT: 15px""><b> Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securities Risks </b>&#8212; Mortgage- and asset-backed securities represent interests in &#8220;pools&#8221; of mortgages or other assets, including consumer loans or receivables held in trust. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are subject to credit, interest rate, prepayment and extension risks. These securities also are subject to risk of default on the underlying mortgage or asset, particularly during periods of economic downturn. Small movements in interest rates (both increases and decreases) may quickly and significantly reduce the value of certain mortgage-backed securities.</p></li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><p style=""PADDING-LEFT: 15px""><b> Prepayment Risk </b>&#8212; When interest rates fall, certain obligations will be paid off by the obligor more quickly than originally anticipated, and the Fund may have to invest the proceeds in securities with lower yields.</p></li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><p style=""PADDING-LEFT: 15px""><b> Repurchase Agreements, Purchase and Sale Contracts Risks </b>&#8212; If the other party to a repurchase agreement or purchase and sale contract defaults on its obligation under the agreement, the Fund may suffer delays and incur costs or lose money in exercising its rights under the agreement. If the seller fails to repurchase the security in either situation and the market value of the security declines, the Fund may lose money.</p></li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><p style=""PADDING-LEFT: 15px""><b> Reverse Repurchase Agreements Risk </b>&#8212; Reverse repurchase agreements involve the sale of securities held by the Fund with an agreement to repurchase the securities at an agreed-upon price, date and interest payment. Reverse repurchase agreements involve the risk that the other party may fail to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund could lose money if it is unable to recover the securities and the value of the collateral held by the Fund, including the value of the investments made with cash collateral, is less than the value of securities. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences to the Fund.</p></li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><p style=""PADDING-LEFT: 15px""><b> U.S. Government Issuer Risk </b>&#8212; Treasury obligations may differ in their interest rates, maturities, times of issuance and other characteristics. Obligations of U.S. Government agencies and authorities are supported by varying degrees of credit but generally are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. No assurance can be given that the U.S. Government will provide financial support to its agencies and authorities if it is not obligated by law to do so. </p></li></ul>"

Strategy Narrative [Text Block],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000018352_MemberClassRshares_Member,,,,,"Under normal circumstances, the Fund invests at least 80% of its assets in inflation-indexed bonds of varying maturities issued by the U.S. and non-U.S. governments, their agencies or instrumentalities, and U.S. and non-U.S. corporations. <br /><br />The Fund maintains an average portfolio duration that is within &#177;20% of the duration of the Barclays Global Real: U.S. TIPS Index (the benchmark). <br/><br/>The Fund may invest up to 20% of it assets in non-investment grade bonds (high yield or junk bonds) or securities of emerging market issuers. The Fund may also invest up to 20% of its assets in non-dollar denominated securities of non-U.S. issuers, and may invest without limit in U.S. dollar denominated securities of non-U.S. issuers.  <br /><br />The Fund is non-diversified under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, which means that it may concentrate its assets in a smaller number of issuers than a diversified fund. <br /><br />The Fund also makes investments in residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and other asset-backed securities. <br /><br />Non-investment grade bonds acquired by the Fund will generally be in the lower rating categories of the major rating agencies (BB or lower by Standard & Poor&#8217;s (&#8220;S&P&#8221;) or Ba or lower by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, Inc. (&#8220;Moody&#8217;s&#8221;)) or will be determined by the management team to be of similar quality. Split rated bonds will be considered to have the higher credit rating. Split rated bonds are bonds that receive different ratings from two or more rating agencies. <br /><br />The Fund may buy or sell options or futures, or enter into credit default swaps and interest rate or foreign currency transactions, including swaps (collectively, commonly known as derivatives). The Fund may seek to obtain market exposure to the securities in which it primarily invests by entering into a series of purchase and sale contracts or by using other investment techniques (such as reverse repurchase agreements or dollar rolls). <br /><br />The Fund may engage in active and frequent trading of portfolio securities to achieve its primary investment strategies."

The Fund invests primarily in securities issued by the GNMA as well as other U.S. Government securities in the five to ten year maturity range. <br /><br />Securities purchased by the Fund are rated in the highest rating category (AAA or Aaa) at the time of purchase by at least one major rating agency or are determined by the Fund management team to be of similar quality. Split rated bonds will be considered to have the higher credit rating. Split rated bonds are bonds that receive different ratings from two or more rating agencies. <br /><br />The Fund measures its performance against the Barclays GNMA MBS Index (the benchmark).

Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000018378_MemberBlackRockShares_Member,,,,,"Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in the Fund, as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment, may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. The following is a summary description of principal risks of investing in the Fund.<ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Credit Risk</b> &#8212; Credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of a security will not be able to make payments of interest and principal when due. Changes in an issuer&#8217;s credit rating or the market&#8217;s perception of an issuer&#8217;s creditworthiness may also affect the value of the Fund&#8217;s investment in that issuer.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Derivatives Risk</b> &#8212; The Fund&#8217;s use of derivatives may reduce the Fund&#8217;s returns and/or increase volatility. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, an index or a market to fluctuate significantly in price within a short time period. Derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund&#8217;s use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the overall securities markets. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund to value accurately. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Recent legislation calls for new regulation of the derivatives markets. The extent and impact of the regulation is not yet known and may not be known for some time. New regulation may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, or may otherwise adversely affect the value or performance of derivatives.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Dollar Rolls Risk</b> &#8212; Dollar rolls involve the risk that the market value of the securities that the Fund is committed to buy may decline below the price of the securities the Fund has sold. These transactions may involve leverage.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Extension Risk</b> &#8212; When interest rates rise, certain obligations will be paid off by the obligor more slowly than anticipated, causing the value of these securities to fall.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>High Portfolio Turnover Risk</b> &#8212; The Fund may engage in active and frequent trading of its portfolio securities. High portfolio turnover (more than 100%) may result in increased transaction costs to the Fund, including brokerage commissions, dealer mark-ups and other transaction costs on the sale of the securities and on reinvestment in other securities. The sale of Fund portfolio securities may result in the realization and/or distribution to shareholders of higher capital gains or losses as compared to a fund with less active trading policies. These effects of higher than normal portfolio turnover may adversely affect Fund performance. In addition, investment in mortgage dollar rolls and participation in TBA transactions may significantly increase the Fund&#8217;s portfolio turnover rate. A TBA transaction is a method of trading mortgage-backed securities where the buyer and seller agree upon general trade parameters such as agency, settlement date, par amount, and price.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Interest Rate Risk</b> &#8212; Interest rate risk is the risk that prices of bonds and other fixed-income securities will increase as interest rates fall, and decrease as interest rates rise.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Leverage Risk</b> &#8212; Some transactions may give rise to a form of economic leverage. These transactions may include, among others, derivatives, and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. The use of leverage may  cause the Fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations or to meet any required asset segregation requirements. Increases and decreases in the value of the Fund&#8217;s portfolio will be magnified when the Fund uses leverage.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Liquidity Risk</b> &#8212; Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell. The Fund&#8217;s investments in illiquid securities may reduce the returns of the Fund because it may be difficult to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. To the extent that the Fund&#8217;s principal investment strategies involve derivatives or securities with substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have the greatest exposure to liquidity risk. Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, particularly during periods of market turmoil. Illiquid investments may be harder to value, especially in changing markets, and if the Fund is forced to sell these investments to meet redemption requests or for other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss. In addition, when there is illiquidity in the market for certain securities, the Fund, due to limitations on illiquid investments, may be subject to purchase and sale restrictions.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Market Risk and Selection Risk</b> &#8212; Market risk is the risk that one or more markets in which the Fund invests will go down in value, including the possibility that the markets will go down sharply and unpredictably. Selection risk is the risk that the securities selected by Fund management will underperform the markets, the relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds with similar investment objectives and investment strategies. This means you may lose money.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securities Risks</b> &#8212; Mortgage- and asset-backed securities represent interests in &#8220;pools&#8221; of mortgages or other assets, including consumer loans or receivables held in trust. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are subject to credit, interest rate, prepayment and extension risks. These securities also are subject to risk of default on the underlying mortgage or asset, particularly during periods of economic downturn. Small movements in interest rates (both increases and decreases) may quickly and significantly reduce the value of certain mortgage-backed securities.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Prepayment Risk</b> &#8212; When interest rates fall, certain obligations will be paid off by the obligor more quickly than originally anticipated, and the Fund may have to invest the proceeds in securities with lower yields.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Repurchase Agreements, Purchase and Sale Contracts Risks</b> &#8212; If the other party to a repurchase agreement or purchase and sale contract defaults on its obligation under the agreement, the Fund may suffer delays and incur costs or lose money in exercising its rights under the agreement. If the seller fails to repurchase the security in either situation and the market value of the security declines, the Fund may lose money.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Reverse Repurchase Agreements Risk</b> &#8212; Reverse repurchase agreements involve the sale of securities held by the Fund with an agreement to repurchase the securities at an agreed-upon price, date and interest payment. Reverse repurchase agreements involve the risk that the other party may fail to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund could lose money if it is unable to recover the securities and the value of the collateral held by the Fund, including the value of the investments made with cash collateral, is less than the value of securities. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences to the Fund.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>U.S. Government Issuer Risk</b> &#8212; Treasury obligations may differ in their interest rates, maturities, times of issuance and other characteristics. Obligations of U.S. Government agencies and authorities are supported by varying degrees of credit but generally are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. No assurance can be given that the U.S. Government will provide financial support to its agencies and authorities if it is not obligated by law to do so.</li></ul>"

Although the chart and table show returns for the Investor A Shares which are not offered in this Prospectus, the Investor A Shares would have substantially similar annual returns as the Class R Shares offered in this Prospectus because the Investor A Shares and the Class R Shares are invested in the same portfolio of securities and the annual returns would differ only to the extent that the Investor A Shares and the Class R Shares do not have the same expenses. The actual return of Class R Shares would have been lower than that of Investor A Shares because Class R Shares have higher expenses than Investor A Shares. Investor A Shares of the Fund are estimated to have expenses of 0.86% of average daily net assets (after waivers and reimbursements) for the current fiscal year and Class R Shares of the Fund are expected to have expenses of 1.21% of average daily net assets (after waivers and reimbursements) for the current fiscal year.<br/><br/>The information shows you how the Fund's performance has varied year by year and provides some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund.

These transactions may include, among others, derivatives, and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. The use of leverage may cause the Fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations or to meet any required asset segregation requirements. Increases and decreases in the value of the Fund&#8217;s portfolio will be magnified when the Fund uses leverage.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Liquidity Risk </b>&#8212; Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell. The Fund&#8217;s investments in illiquid securities may reduce the returns of the Fund because it may be difficult to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. To the extent that the Fund&#8217;s principal investment strategies involve derivatives or securities with substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have the greatest exposure to liquidity risk. Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, particularly during periods of market turmoil. Illiquid investments may be harder to value, especially in changing markets, and if the Fund is forced to sell these investments to meet redemption requests or for other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss. In addition, when there is illiquidity in the market for certain securities, the Fund, due to limitations on illiquid investments, may be subject to purchase and sale restrictions.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Market Risk and Selection Risk </b>&#8212; Market risk is the risk that one or more markets in which the Fund invests will go down in value, including the possibility that the markets will go down sharply and unpredictably. Selection risk is the risk that the securities selected by Fund management will underperform the markets, the relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds with similar investment objectives and investment strategies. This means you may lose money.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securities Risks </b>&#8212; Mortgage- and asset-backed securities represent interests in &#8220;pools&#8221; of mortgages or other assets, including consumer loans or receivables held in trust. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are subject to credit, interest rate, prepayment and extension risks. These securities also are subject to risk of default on the underlying mortgage or asset, particularly during periods of economic downturn. Small movements in interest rates (both increases and decreases) may quickly and significantly reduce the value of certain mortgage-backed securities.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Prepayment Risk </b>&#8212; When interest rates fall, certain obligations will be paid off by the obligor more quickly than originally anticipated, and the Fund may have to invest the proceeds in securities with lower yields.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Repurchase Agreements, Purchase and Sale Contracts Risks </b>&#8212; If the other party to a repurchase agreement or purchase and sale contract defaults on its obligation under the agreement, the Fund may suffer delays and incur costs or lose money in exercising its rights under the agreement. If the seller fails to repurchase the security in either situation and the market value of the security declines, the Fund may lose money.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Reverse Repurchase Agreements Risk </b>&#8212; Reverse repurchase agreements involve the sale of securities held by the Fund with an agreement to repurchase the securities at an agreed-upon price, date and interest payment. Reverse repurchase agreements involve the risk that the other party may fail to return the securities in a timely manner or at  all. The Fund could lose money if it is unable to recover the securities and the value of the collateral held by the Fund, including the value of the investments made with cash collateral, is less than the value of securities. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences to the Fund.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>U.S. Government Issuer Risk </b>&#8212; Treasury obligations may differ in their interest rates, maturities, times of issuance and other characteristics. Obligations of U.S. Government agencies and authorities are supported by varying degrees of credit but generally are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. No assurance can be given that the U.S. Government will provide financial support to its agencies and authorities if it is not obligated by law to do so.</li></ul>"

The Fund invests primarily in securities issued by the GNMA as well as other U.S. Government securities in the five to ten year maturity range. <br/><br/> Securities purchased by the Fund are rated in the highest rating category (AAA or Aaa) at the time of purchase by at least one major rating agency or are determined by the Fund management team to be of similar quality. Split rated bonds will be considered to have the higher credit rating. Split rated bonds are bonds that receive different ratings from two or more rating agencies.<br/><br/>The Fund measures its performance against the Barclays GNMA MBS Index (the benchmark). The Fund management team will normally attempt to structure the Fund&#8217;s portfolio to have comparable duration to its benchmark.<br/><br/>The Fund also makes investments in residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and other asset-backed securities.<br/><br/>The Fund may buy or sell options or futures on a security or an index of securities, or enter into credit default swaps and interest rate transactions, including swaps (collectively, commonly known as derivatives). The Fund may seek to obtain market exposure to the securities in which it primarily invests by entering into a series of purchase and sale contracts or by using other investment techniques (such as reverse repurchase agreements or dollar rolls).<br/><br/>The Fund may engage in active and frequent trading of portfolio securities to achieve its primary investment strategies."

The Fund invests primarily in the highest rated government and agency bonds and maintains an average portfolio duration that is within &#177;20% of the Barclays U.S. Government/Mortgage Index (the benchmark).<br/><br/>Securities purchased by the Fund generally are rated in the highest rating category (AAA or Aaa) at the time of purchase by at least one major rating agency or are determined by the Fund management team to be of similar quality. In addition, the Fund&#8217;s dollar-weighted average maturity will be between 3 and 10 years.<br/><br/>The Fund evaluates sectors of the bond market and individual securities within these sectors. The Fund selects bonds from several sectors including: U.S. Treasuries and agency securities, commercial and residential mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations (&#8220;CMOs&#8221;), asset-backed securities and corporate bonds. <br/><br/>The Fund invests primarily in dollar-denominated bonds, but may invest up to 10% of its assets in non-dollar denominated bonds of issuers located outside of the United States. The Fund&#8217;s investment in non-dollar denominated bonds may be on a currency hedged or unhedged basis.<br/><br/>The Fund may buy or sell options or futures on a security or an index of securities, or enter into credit default swaps and interest rate or foreign currency transactions, including swaps (collectively, commonly known as derivatives). The Fund may seek to obtain market exposure to the securities in which it primarily invests by entering into a series of purchase and sale contracts or by using other investment techniques (such as reverse repurchase agreements or dollar rolls).<br/><br/> The Fund may engage in active and frequent trading of portfolio securities to achieve its primary investment strategies."

Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000018354_MemberBlackRockShares_Member,,,,,"Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in the Fund, as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment, may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. The following is a summary description of principal risks of investing in the Fund. <br /> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Credit Risk </b>&#8212; Credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of a security will not be able to make payments of interest and principal when due. Changes in an issuer&#8217;s credit rating or the market&#8217;s perception of an issuer&#8217;s creditworthiness may also affect the value of the Fund&#8217;s investment in that issuer.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Derivatives Risk </b>&#8212; The Fund&#8217;s use of derivatives may reduce the Fund&#8217;s returns and/or increase volatility. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, an index or a market to fluctuate significantly in price within a short time period. Derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction  will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund&#8217;s use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the overall securities markets. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund to value accurately. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Recent legislation calls for new regulation of the derivatives markets. The extent and impact of the regulation is not yet known and may not be known for some time. New regulation may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, or may otherwise adversely affect the value or performance of derivatives. </li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Dollar Rolls Risk </b>&#8212; Dollar rolls involve the risk that the market value of the securities that the Fund is committed to buy may decline below the price of the securities the Fund has sold. These transactions may involve leverage.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Extension Risk </b>&#8212; When interest rates rise, certain obligations will be paid off by the obligor more slowly than anticipated, causing the value of these securities to fall.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Foreign Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Foreign investments often involve special risks not present in U.S. investments that can increase the chances that the Fund will lose money. These risks include:</li></ul><div><table style=""border-collapse: collapse;"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%""> <tr><td width=""3%""><font class=""_mt"" size=""1""> </font></td> <td valign=""top"" width=""3%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left""><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"">The Fund generally holds its foreign securities and cash in foreign banks and securities depositories, which may be recently organized or new to the foreign custody business and may be subject to only limited or no regulatory oversight.</p></td></tr></table></div><br/><div><table style=""border-collapse: collapse;"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%""> <tr><td width=""3%""><font class=""_mt"" size=""1""> </font></td> <td valign=""top"" width=""3%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left""><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"">Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the value of the Fund&#8217;s portfolio.</p></td></tr></table></div><br/>  <div><table style=""border-collapse: collapse;"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%""> <tr><td width=""3%""><font class=""_mt"" size=""1""> </font></td> <td valign=""top"" width=""3%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left""><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"">The economies of certain foreign markets may not compare favorably with the economy of the United States with respect to such issues as growth of gross national product, reinvestment of capital, resources and balance of payments position.</p></td></tr></table></div><br/><div><table style=""border-collapse: collapse;"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%""> <tr><td width=""3%""><font class=""_mt"" size=""1""> </font></td> <td valign=""top"" width=""3%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left""><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"">The governments of certain countries may prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on foreign investments in their capital markets or in certain industries.   </p></td></tr></table></div><br/><div><table style=""border-collapse: collapse;"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%""> <tr><td width=""3%""><font class=""_mt"" size=""1""> </font></td> <td valign=""top"" width=""3%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left""><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"">Many foreign governments do not supervise and regulate stock exchanges, brokers and the sale of securities to the same extent as does the United States and may not have laws to protect investors that are comparable to U.S. securities laws.   </p></td></tr></table></div><br/><div><table style=""border-collapse: collapse;"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%""> <tr><td width=""3%""><font class=""_mt"" size=""1""> </font></td> <td valign=""top"" width=""3%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left""><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"">Settlement and clearance procedures in certain foreign markets may result in delays in payment for or delivery of securities not typically associated with settlement and clearance of U.S. investments.</p></td></tr></table></div><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>High Portfolio Turnover Risk </b>&#8212; The Fund may engage in active and frequent trading of its portfolio securities. High portfolio turnover (more than 100%) may result in increased transaction costs to the Fund, including brokerage commissions, dealer mark-ups and other transaction costs on the sale of the securities and on reinvestment in other securities. The sale of Fund portfolio securities may result in the realization and/or distribution to shareholders of higher capital gains or losses as compared to a fund with less active trading policies. These effects of higher than normal portfolio turnover may adversely affect Fund performance. In addition, investment in mortgage dollar rolls and participation in TBA transactions may significantly increase the Fund&#8217;s portfolio turnover rate. A TBA transaction is a method of trading mortgage-backed securities where the buyer and seller agree upon general trade parameters such as agency, settlement date, par amount, and price.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Interest Rate Risk </b>&#8212; Interest rate risk is the risk that prices of bonds and other fixed-income securities will increase as interest rates fall, and decrease as interest rates rise.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Leverage Risk </b>&#8212; Some transactions may give rise to a form of economic leverage. These transactions may include, among others, derivatives, and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. The use of leverage may cause the Fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations or to meet any required asset segregation requirements. Increases and decreases in the value of the Fund&#8217;s portfolio will be magnified when the Fund uses leverage.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Liquidity Risk </b>&#8212; Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell. The Fund&#8217;s investments in illiquid securities may reduce the returns of the Fund because it may be difficult to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. To the extent that the Fund&#8217;s principal investment strategies involve derivatives or securities with substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have the greatest exposure to liquidity risk. Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, particularly during periods of market turmoil. Illiquid investments may be harder to value, especially in changing markets, and if the Fund is forced to sell these investments to meet redemption requests or for other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss. In addition, when there is illiquidity in the market for certain securities, the Fund, due to limitations on illiquid investments, may be subject to purchase and sale restrictions.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Market Risk and Selection Risk </b>&#8212; Market risk is the risk that one or more markets in which the Fund invests will go down in value, including the possibility that the markets will go down sharply and unpredictably. Selection risk is the risk that the securities selected by Fund management will underperform the markets, the relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds with similar investment objectives and investment strategies. This means you may lose money.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securities Risks</b> &#8212; Mortgage- and asset-backed securities represent interests in &#8220;pools&#8221; of mortgages or other assets, including consumer loans or receivables held in trust. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are subject to credit, interest rate, prepayment and extension risks. These securities also are subject to risk of default on the underlying mortgage or asset, particularly during periods of economic downturn. Small movements in interest rates (both increases and decreases) may quickly and significantly reduce the value of certain mortgage-backed securities.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Prepayment Risk</b> &#8212; When interest rates fall, certain obligations will be paid off by the obligor more quickly than originally anticipated, and the Fund may have to invest the proceeds in securities with lower yields.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Repurchase Agreements, Purchase and Sale Contracts Risks </b>&#8212; If the other party to a repurchase agreement or purchase and sale contract defaults on its obligation under the agreement, the Fund may suffer delays and incur costs or lose money in exercising its rights under the agreement. If the seller fails to repurchase the security in either situation and the market value of the security declines, the Fund may lose money.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Reverse Repurchase Agreements Risk </b>&#8212; Reverse repurchase agreements involve the sale of securities held by the Fund with an agreement to repurchase the securities at an agreed-upon price, date and interest payment. Reverse repurchase agreements involve the risk that the other party may fail to return the securities in a timely manner or at  all. The Fund could lose money if it is unable to recover the securities and the value of the collateral held by the Fund, including the value of the investments made with cash collateral, is less than the value of securities. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences to the Fund.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>U.S. Government Issuer Risk</b> &#8212; Treasury obligations may differ in their interest rates, maturities, times of issuance and other characteristics. Obligations of U.S. Government agencies and authorities are supported by varying degrees of credit but generally are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. No assurance can be given that the U.S. Government will provide financial support to its agencies and authorities if it is not obligated by law to do so.</li></ul>"

Although the chart and table show returns for the Investor A Shares which are not offered in this Prospectus, the Investor A Shares would have substantially similar annual returns as the BlackRock Shares offered in this Prospectus because the Investor A Shares and the BlackRock Shares are invested in the same portfolio of securities and the annual returns would differ only to the extent that the Investor A Shares and the BlackRock Shares do not have the same expenses. The actual return of BlackRock Shares would have been higher than that of Investor A Shares because BlackRock Shares have lower expenses than Investor A Shares. Investor A Shares of the Fund are estimated to have expenses of 1.05% of average daily net assets (after waivers and reimbursements) for the current fiscal year and BlackRock Shares of the Fund are expected to have expenses of 0.45% of average daily net assets (after waivers and reimbursements) for the current fiscal year.<br/><br/>The information shows you how the Fund&#8217;s performance has varied year by year and provides some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund.

The Fund selects bonds from several sectors including: U.S. Treasuries and agency securities, commercial and residential mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations (&#8220;CMOs&#8221;), pass-throughs, asset-backed securities, corporate bonds and taxable and tax-exempt municipal bonds.

The Fund&#8217;s investment in non-dollar denominated bonds may be on a currency hedged or unhedged basis. Non-investment grade bonds acquired by the Fund will generally be in the lower rating categories of the major rating agencies (BB or lower by Standard & Poor&#8217;s (&#8220;S&P&#8221;) or Ba or lower by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, Inc.

Split rated bonds will be considered to have the higher credit rating. Split rated bonds are bonds that receive different ratings from two or more rating agencies. <br /><br /> The Fund may buy or sell options or futures on a security or an index of securities, or enter into credit default swaps and interest rate or foreign currency transactions, including swaps (collectively, commonly known as derivatives). The Fund may seek to obtain market exposure to the securities in which it primarily invests by entering into a series of purchase and sale contracts or by using other investment techniques (such as reverse repurchase agreements or dollar rolls). <br /><br /> The Fund may engage in active and frequent trading of portfolio securities to achieve its primary investment strategies."

Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000018354_MemberPrimeShares_Member,,,,,"Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in the Fund, as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment, may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. The following is a summary description of principal risks of investing in the Fund.  <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""> <b>Credit Risk</b> &#8212; Credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of a security will not be able to make payments of interest and principal when due. Changes in an issuer&#8217;s credit rating or the market&#8217;s perception of an issuer&#8217;s creditworthiness may also affect the value of the Fund&#8217;s investment in that issuer. </li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""> <b>Derivatives Risk</b> &#8212; The Fund&#8217;s use of derivatives may reduce the Fund&#8217;s returns and/or increase volatility. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, an index or a market to fluctuate significantly in price within a short time period. Derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund&#8217;s use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the overall securities markets. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund to value accurately. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Recent legislation calls for new regulation of the derivatives markets. The extent and impact of the regulation is not yet known and may not be known for some time. New regulation may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, or may otherwise adversely affect the value or performance of derivatives. </li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""> <b>Dollar Rolls Risk</b> &#8212; Dollar rolls involve the risk that the market value of the securities that the Fund is committed to buy may decline below the price of the securities the Fund has sold. These transactions may involve leverage. </li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""> <b>Extension Risk</b> &#8212; When interest rates rise, certain obligations will be paid off by the obligor more slowly than anticipated, causing the value of these securities to fall. </li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Foreign Securities Risk &#8212; </b>Foreign investments often involve special risks not present in U.S. investments that can increase the chances that the Fund will lose money. These risks include:</li></ul><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: -6px""> </p> <table style=""border-collapse: collapse"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%"">  <tr> <td width=""2%""> </td> <td valign=""top"" width=""3%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left"">The Fund generally holds its foreign securities and cash in foreign banks and securities depositories, which may be recently organized or new to the foreign custody business and may be subject to only limited or no regulatory oversight. </td></tr></table> <p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: -6px""> </p> <table style=""border-collapse: collapse"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%"">  <tr> <td width=""2%""> </td> <td valign=""top"" width=""3%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left"">Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the value of the Fund's portfolio. </td></tr></table> <p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: -6px""> </p> <table style=""border-collapse: collapse"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%"">  <tr> <td width=""2%""> </td> <td valign=""top"" width=""3%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left"">The economies of certain foreign markets may not compare favorably with the economy of the United States with respect to such issues as growth of gross national product, reinvestment of capital, resources and balance of payments position. </td></tr></table> <p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: -6px""> </p> <table style=""border-collapse: collapse"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%"">  <tr> <td width=""2%""> </td> <td valign=""top"" width=""3%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left"">The governments of certain countries may prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on foreign investments in their capital markets or in certain industries. </td></tr></table> <p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: -6px""> </p> <table style=""border-collapse: collapse"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%"">  <tr> <td width=""2%""> </td> <td valign=""top"" width=""3%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left"">Many foreign governments do not supervise and regulate stock exchanges, brokers and the sale of securities to the same extent as does the United States and may not have laws to protect investors that are comparable to U.S. securities laws.   </td></tr></table> <p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: -6px""> </p> <table style=""border-collapse: collapse"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%"">  <tr> <td width=""2%""> </td> <td valign=""top"" width=""3%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left"">Settlement and clearance procedures in certain foreign markets may result in delays in payment for or delivery of securities not typically associated with settlement and clearance of U.S. investments. </td></tr></table><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>High Portfolio Turnover Risk</b> &#8212; The Fund may engage in active and frequent trading of its portfolio securities. High portfolio turnover (more than 100%) may result in increased transaction costs to the Fund, including brokerage commissions, dealer mark-ups and other transaction costs on the sale of the securities and on reinvestment in other securities. The sale of Fund portfolio securities may result in the realization and/or distribution to shareholders of higher capital gains or losses as compared to a fund with less active trading policies. These effects of higher than normal portfolio turnover may adversely affect Fund performance. In addition, investment in mortgage dollar rolls and participation in TBA transactions may significantly increase the Fund&#8217;s portfolio turnover rate. A TBA transaction is a method of trading mortgage-backed securities where the buyer and seller agree upon general trade parameters such as agency, settlement date, par amount, and price. </li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Interest Rate Risk</b> &#8212; Interest rate risk is the risk that prices of bonds and other fixed-income securities will increase as interest rates fall, and decrease as interest rates rise. </li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Leverage Risk</b> &#8212; Some transactions may give rise to a form of economic leverage. These transactions may include, among others, derivatives, and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. The use of leverage may cause the Fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations or to meet any required asset segregation requirements. Increases and decreases in the value of the Fund&#8217;s portfolio will be magnified when the Fund uses leverage. </li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Liquidity Risk</b> &#8212; Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell. The Fund&#8217;s investments in illiquid securities may reduce the returns of the Fund because it may be difficult to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. To the extent that the Fund&#8217;s principal investment strategies involve derivatives or securities with substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have the greatest exposure to liquidity risk. Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, particularly during periods of market turmoil. Illiquid investments may be harder to value, especially in changing markets, and if the Fund is forced to sell these investments to meet redemption requests or for other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss. In addition, when there is illiquidity in the market for certain securities, the Fund, due to limitations on illiquid investments, may be subject to purchase and sale restrictions. </li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Market Risk and Selection Risk </b>&#8212; Market risk is the risk that one or more markets in which the Fund invests will go down in value, including the possibility that the markets will go down sharply and unpredictably. Selection risk is the risk that the securities selected by Fund management will underperform the markets, the relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds with similar investment objectives and investment strategies. This means you may lose money. </li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securities Risks</b> &#8212; Mortgage- and asset-backed securities represent interests in &#8220;pools&#8221; of mortgages or other assets, including consumer loans or receivables held in trust. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are subject to credit, interest rate, prepayment and extension risks. These securities also are subject to risk of default on the underlying mortgage or asset, particularly during periods of economic downturn. Small movements in interest rates (both increases and decreases) may quickly and significantly reduce the value of certain mortgage-backed securities. </li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Prepayment Risk</b> &#8212; When interest rates fall, certain obligations will be paid off by the obligor more quickly than originally anticipated, and the Fund may have to invest the proceeds in securities with lower yields. </li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Repurchase Agreements, Purchase and Sale Contracts Risks</b> &#8212; If the other party to a repurchase agreement or purchase and sale contract defaults on its obligation under the agreement, the Fund may suffer delays and incur  costs or lose money in exercising its rights under the agreement. If the seller fails to repurchase the security in either situation and the market value of the security declines, the Fund may lose money. </li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Reverse Repurchase Agreements Risk</b> &#8212; Reverse repurchase agreements involve the sale of securities held by the Fund with an agreement to repurchase the securities at an agreed-upon price, date and interest payment. Reverse repurchase agreements involve the risk that the other party may fail to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund could lose money if it is unable to recover the securities and the value of the collateral held by the Fund, including the value of the investments made with cash collateral, is less than the value of securities. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences to the Fund. </li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>U.S. Government Issuer Risk</b> &#8212; Treasury obligations may differ in their interest rates, maturities, times of issuance and other characteristics. Obligations of U.S. Government agencies and authorities are supported by varying degrees of credit but generally are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. No assurance can be given that the U.S. Government will provide financial support to its agencies and authorities if it is not obligated by law to do so. </li></ul>"

The Fund selects bonds from several sectors including: U.S. Treasuries and agency securities, commercial and residential mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations (""CMOs""), pass-throughs, asset-backed securities, corporate bonds and taxable and tax-exempt municipal bonds. The Fund may also invest in preferred stock.<br/><br/>  The Fund invests primarily in dollar-denominated investment grade bonds, but may invest up to 20% of its assets in any combination of non-investment grade bonds (high yield or junk bonds), non-dollar denominated bonds and bonds of emerging market issuers. The Fund's investment in non-dollar denominated bonds may be on a currency hedged or unhedged basis. Non-investment grade bonds acquired by the Fund will generally be in the lower rating categories of the major rating agencies (BB or lower by Standard &#38; Poor's (""S&#38;P"") or Ba or lower by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (""Moody's"")) or will be determined by the management team to be of similar quality. The Fund may invest in securities rated in the category C and above or determined by the management team to be of comparable quality. Split rated bonds will be considered to have the higher credit rating. Split rated bonds are bonds that receive different ratings from two or more rating agencies.<br/><br/>  The Fund may buy or sell options or futures on a security or an index of securities, or enter into credit default swaps and interest rate or foreign currency transactions, including swaps (collectively, commonly known as derivatives). The Fund may seek to obtain market exposure to the securities in which it primarily invests by entering into a series of purchase and sale contracts or by using other investment techniques (such as reverse repurchase agreements or dollar rolls).<br/><br/>  The Fund may engage in active and frequent trading of portfolio securities to achieve its primary investment strategies."

New regulation may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, or may otherwise adversely affect the value or performance of derivatives.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Dollar Rolls Risk</b> &#8212; Dollar rolls involve the risk that the market value of the securities that the Fund is committed to buy may decline below the price of the securities the Fund has sold.

High portfolio turnover (more than 100%) may result in increased transaction costs to the Fund, including brokerage commissions, dealer mark-ups and other transaction costs on the sale of the securities and on reinvestment in other securities. The sale of Fund portfolio securities may result in the realization and/or distribution to shareholders of higher capital gains or losses as compared to a fund with less active trading policies. These effects of higher than normal portfolio turnover may adversely affect Fund performance. In addition, investment in mortgage dollar rolls and participation in TBA transactions may significantly increase the Fund&#8217;s portfolio turnover rate. A TBA transaction is a method of trading mortgage-backed securities where the buyer and seller agree upon general trade parameters such as agency, settlement date, par amount, and price.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Inflation Indexed Bonds </b>&#8212; The principal value of an investment is not protected or otherwise guaranteed by virtue of the Fund&#8217;s investments in inflation-indexed bonds.<br/><br/>Inflation-indexed bonds are fixed-income securities whose principal value is periodically adjusted according to the rate of inflation. If the index measuring inflation falls, the principal value of inflation-indexed bonds will be adjusted downward, and consequently the interest payable on these securities (calculated with respect to a smaller principal amount) will be reduced.<br/><br/>Repayment of the original bond principal upon maturity (as adjusted for inflation) is guaranteed in the case of U.S. Treasury inflation-indexed bonds. For bonds that do not provide a similar guarantee, the adjusted principal value of the bond repaid at maturity may be less than the original principal value.<br/><br/>The value of inflation-indexed bonds is expected to change in response to changes in real interest rates. Real interest rates are tied to the relationship between nominal interest rates and the rate of inflation. If nominal interest rates increase at a faster rate than inflation, real interest rates may rise, leading to a decrease in value of inflation-indexed bonds. Short-term increases in inflation may lead to a decline in value. Any increase in the principal amount of an inflation-indexed bond will be considered taxable ordinary income, even though investors do not receive their principal until maturity.<br/><br/>Periodic adjustments for inflation to the principal amount of an inflation-indexed bond may give rise to original issue discount, which will be includable in the Fund's gross income. Due to original issue discount, the Fund may be required to make annual distributions to shareholders that exceed the cash received, which may cause the Fund to liquidate certain investments when it is not advantageous to do so. Also, if the principal value of an inflation-indexed bond is adjusted downward due to deflation, amounts previously distributed in the taxable year may be characterized in some circumstances as a return of capital.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Interest Rate Risk</b> &#8212; Interest rate risk is the risk that prices of bonds and other fixed-income securities will increase as interest rates fall, and decrease as interest rates rise.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Leverage Risk</b> &#8212; Some transactions may give rise to a form of economic leverage. These transactions may include, among others, derivatives, and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. The use of leverage may cause the Fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations or to meet any required asset segregation requirements. Increases and decreases in the value of the Fund&#8217;s portfolio will be magnified when the Fund uses leverage.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Liquidity Risk </b>&#8212; Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell. The Fund&#8217;s investments in illiquid securities may reduce the returns of the Fund because it may be difficult to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. To the extent that the Fund&#8217;s principal investment strategies involve derivatives or securities with substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have the greatest exposure to liquidity risk. Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, particularly during periods of market turmoil. Illiquid investments may be harder to value, especially in changing markets, and if the Fund is forced to sell these investments to meet redemption requests or for other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss. In addition, when there is illiquidity in the market for certain securities, the Fund, due to limitations on illiquid investments, may be subject to purchase and sale restrictions.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Market Risk and Selection Risk</b> &#8212; Market risk is the risk that one or more markets in which the Fund invests will go down in value, including the possibility that the markets will go down sharply and unpredictably. Selection risk is the risk that the securities selected by Fund management will underperform the markets, the relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds with similar investment objectives and investment strategies. This means you may lose money.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securities Risks </b>&#8212; Mortgage- and asset-backed securities represent interests in &#8220;pools&#8221; of mortgages or other assets, including consumer loans or receivables held in trust. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are subject to credit, interest rate, prepayment and extension risks. These securities also are subject to risk of default on the underlying mortgage or asset, particularly during periods of economic downturn. Small movements in interest rates (both increases and decreases) may quickly and significantly reduce the value of certain mortgage-backed securities.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Non-Diversification Risk</b> &#8212; The Fund is a non-diversified fund.

Risk Lose Money [Text],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000018354_MemberPrimeShares_Member,,,,,You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments.
Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000018354_MemberInvestorInstitutionalAndRshares_Member,,,,,"Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in the Fund, as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment, may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. The following is a summary description of principal risks of investing in the Fund. <br /> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Credit Risk</b> &#8212; Credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of a security will not be able to make payments of interest and principal when due. Changes in an issuer&#8217;s credit rating or the market&#8217;s perception of an issuer&#8217;s creditworthiness may also affect the value of the Fund&#8217;s investment in that issuer.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Derivatives Risk</b> &#8212; The Fund&#8217;s use of derivatives may reduce the Fund&#8217;s returns and/or increase volatility. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, an index or a market to fluctuate significantly in price within a short time period. Derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction  will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund&#8217;s use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the overall securities markets. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund to value accurately. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Recent legislation calls for new regulation of the derivatives markets. The extent and impact of the regulation is not yet known and may not be known for some time. New regulation may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, or may otherwise adversely affect the value or performance of derivatives. </li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Dollar Rolls Risk</b> &#8212; Dollar rolls involve the risk that the market value of the securities that the Fund is committed to buy may decline below the price of the securities the Fund has sold.

Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000018357_MemberBlackRockShares_Member,,,,,"Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in the Fund, as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment, may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. The following is a summary description of principal risks of investing in the Fund. <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Credit Risk</b> &#8212; Credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of a security will not be able to make payments of interest and principal when due. Changes in an issuer&#8217;s credit rating or the market&#8217;s perception of an issuer&#8217;s creditworthiness may also affect the value of the Fund&#8217;s investment in that issuer.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Derivatives Risk</b> &#8212; The Fund&#8217;s use of derivatives may reduce the Fund&#8217;s returns and/or increase volatility. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, an index or a market to fluctuate significantly in price within a short time period. Derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund&#8217;s use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the overall securities markets. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund to value accurately. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Recent legislation calls for new regulation of the derivatives markets. The extent and impact of the regulation is not yet known and may not be known for some time. New regulation may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, or may otherwise adversely affect the value or performance of derivatives.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""> <b>Dollar Rolls Risk</b> &#8212; Dollar rolls involve the risk that the market value of the securities that the Fund is committed to buy may decline below the price of the securities the Fund has sold. These transactions may involve leverage.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b> Emerging Markets Risk</b> &#8212; Emerging markets are riskier than more developed markets because they tend to develop unevenly and may never fully develop. Investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative. Emerging markets are more likely to experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations, which adversely affect returns to U.S. investors. In addition, many emerging securities markets have far lower trading volumes and less liquidity than developed markets.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b> Extension Risk</b> &#8212; When interest rates rise, certain obligations will be paid off by the obligor more slowly than anticipated, causing the value of these securities to fall.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Foreign Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Foreign investments often involve special risks not present in U.S. investments that can increase the chances that the Fund will lose money. These risks include:</li></ul> <div><table style=""border-collapse: collapse;"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%""> <tr><td width=""3%""><font class=""_mt"" size=""1""> </font></td> <td valign=""top"" width=""3%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left""><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"">The Fund generally holds its foreign securities and cash in foreign banks and securities depositories, which may be recently organized or new to the foreign custody business and may be subject to only limited or no regulatory oversight.</p></td></tr></table></div><br/>  <div><table style=""border-collapse: collapse;"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%""> <tr><td width=""3%""><font class=""_mt"" size=""1""> </font></td> <td valign=""top"" width=""3%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left""><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"">Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the value of the Fund&#8217;s portfolio. </p></td></tr></table></div><br/> <div><table style=""border-collapse: collapse;"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%""> <tr><td width=""3%""><font class=""_mt"" size=""1""> </font></td> <td valign=""top"" width=""3%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left""><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"">The economies of certain foreign markets may not compare favorably with the economy of the United States with respect to such issues as growth of gross national product, reinvestment of capital, resources and balance of payments position.</p></td></tr></table></div><br/> <div><table style=""border-collapse: collapse;"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%""> <tr><td width=""3%""><font class=""_mt"" size=""1""> </font></td> <td valign=""top"" width=""3%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left""><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"">The governments of certain countries may prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on foreign investments in their capital markets or in certain industries. </p></td></tr></table></div><br/> <div><table style=""border-collapse: collapse;"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%""> <tr><td width=""3%""><font class=""_mt"" size=""1""> </font></td> <td valign=""top"" width=""3%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left""><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"">Many foreign governments do not supervise and regulate stock exchanges, brokers and the sale of securities to the same extent as does the United States and may not have laws to protect investors that are comparable to U.S. securities laws.</p></td></tr></table></div><br/> <div><table style=""border-collapse: collapse;"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%""> <tr><td width=""3%""><font class=""_mt"" size=""1""> </font></td> <td valign=""top"" width=""3%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left""><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"">Settlement and clearance procedures in certain foreign markets may result in delays in payment for or delivery of securities not typically associated with settlement and clearance of U.S. investments. </p></td></tr></table></div><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>High Portfolio Turnover Risk</b> &#8212; The Fund may engage in active and frequent trading of its portfolio securities. High portfolio turnover (more than 100%) may result in increased transaction costs to the Fund, including brokerage commissions, dealer mark-ups and other transaction costs on the sale of the securities and on reinvestment in other securities. The sale of Fund portfolio securities may result in the realization and/or distribution to shareholders of higher capital gains or losses as compared to a fund with less active trading policies. These effects of higher than normal portfolio turnover may adversely affect Fund performance. In addition, investment in mortgage dollar rolls and participation in TBA transactions may significantly increase the Fund&#8217;s portfolio turnover rate. A TBA transaction is a method of trading mortgage-backed securities where the buyer and seller agree upon general trade parameters such as agency, settlement date, par amount, and price.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b> Interest Rate Risk</b> &#8212; Interest rate risk is the risk that prices of bonds and other fixed-income securities will increase as interest rates fall, and decrease as interest rates rise.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""> <b>Leverage Risk</b> &#8212; Some transactions may give rise to a form of economic leverage. These transactions may include, among others, derivatives, and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. The use of leverage may cause the Fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations or to meet any required asset segregation requirements. Increases and decreases in the value of the Fund&#8217;s portfolio will be magnified when the Fund uses leverage.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""> <b>Liquidity Risk</b> &#8212; Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell. The Fund&#8217;s investments in illiquid securities may reduce the returns of the Fund because it may be difficult to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. To the extent that the Fund&#8217;s principal investment strategies involve derivatives or securities with substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have the greatest exposure to liquidity risk. Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, particularly during periods of market turmoil. Illiquid investments may be harder to value, especially in changing markets, and if the Fund is forced to sell these investments to meet redemption requests or for other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss. In addition, when there is illiquidity in the market for certain securities, the Fund, due to limitations on illiquid investments, may be subject to purchase and sale restrictions.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b> Market Risk and Selection Risk</b> &#8212; Market risk is the risk that one or more markets in which the Fund invests will go down in value, including the possibility that the markets will go down sharply and unpredictably. Selection risk is the risk that the securities selected by Fund management will underperform the markets, the relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds with similar investment objectives and investment strategies. This means you may lose money.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securities Risks</b> &#8212; Mortgage- and asset-backed securities represent interests in &#8220;pools&#8221; of mortgages or other assets, including consumer loans or receivables held in trust. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are subject to credit, interest rate, prepayment and extension risks. These securities also are subject to risk of default on the underlying mortgage or asset, particularly during periods of economic downturn. Small movements in interest rates (both increases and decreases) may quickly and significantly reduce the value of certain mortgage-backed securities.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b> Municipal Bonds Risk</b> &#8212; Municipal bonds are subject to interest rate, credit and market risk. The ability of an issuer to make payments could be affected by litigation, legislation or other political events or the bankruptcy of the issuer. Lower rated municipal bonds are subject to greater credit and market risk than higher quality municipal bonds. The market prices of residual interest bonds may be highly sensitive to changes in market rates and may decrease significantly when market rates increase.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b> Non-Investment Grade Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Although non-investment grade securities generally pay higher rates of interest than investment grade securities, non-investment grade securities are high risk investments that may cause income and principal losses for the Fund.</li></ul>  <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b> Prepayment Risk</b> &#8212; When interest rates fall, certain obligations will be paid off by the obligor more quickly than originally anticipated, and the Fund may have to invest the proceeds in securities with lower yields.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b> Repurchase Agreements, Purchase and Sale Contracts Risks</b> &#8212; If the other party to a repurchase agreement or purchase and sale contract defaults on its obligation under the agreement, the Fund may suffer delays and incur costs or lose money in exercising its rights under the agreement. If the seller fails to repurchase the security in either situation and the market value of the security declines, the Fund may lose money.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b> Reverse Repurchase Agreements Risk</b> &#8212; Reverse repurchase agreements involve the sale of securities held by the Fund with an agreement to repurchase the securities at an agreed-upon price, date and interest payment. Reverse repurchase agreements involve the risk that the other party may fail to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund could lose money if it is unable to recover the securities and the value of the collateral held by the Fund, including the value of the investments made with cash collateral, is less than the value of securities. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences to the Fund.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b> U.S. Government Issuer Risk</b> &#8212; Treasury obligations may differ in their interest rates, maturities, times of issuance and other characteristics. Obligations of U.S. Government agencies and authorities are supported by varying degrees of credit but generally are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. No assurance can be given that the U.S. Government will provide financial support to its agencies and authorities if it is not obligated by law to do so.</li></ul>"

Strategy Narrative [Text Block],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000018354_MemberPrimeShares_Member,,,,,"Under normal circumstances, the Fund invests at least 80% of its assets in bonds that are issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government and its agencies. The Fund invests primarily in the highest rated government and agency bonds and maintains an average portfolio duration that is within &#177;20% of the Barclays U.S. Government/Mortgage Index (the benchmark). <br /><br />Securities purchased by the Fund generally are rated in the highest rating category (AAA or Aaa) at the time of purchase by at least one major rating agency or are determined by the Fund management team to be of similar quality. In addition, the Fund&#8217;s dollar-weighted average maturity will be between 3 and 10 years. <br /><br />The Fund evaluates sectors of the bond market and individual securities within these sectors. The Fund selects bonds from several sectors including: U.S. Treasuries and agency securities, commercial and residential mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations (&#8220;CMOs&#8221;), asset-backed securities and corporate bonds. <br /><br />The Fund invests primarily in dollar-denominated bonds, but may invest up to 10% of its assets in non-dollar denominated bonds of issuers located outside of the United States. The Fund&#8217;s investment in non-dollar denominated bonds may be on a currency hedged or unhedged basis. <br /><br />The Fund may buy or sell options or futures on a security or an index of securities, or enter into credit default swaps and interest rate or foreign currency transactions, including swaps (collectively, commonly known as derivatives). The Fund may seek to obtain market exposure to the securities in which it primarily invests by entering into a series of purchase and sale contracts or by using other investment techniques (such as reverse repurchase agreements or dollar rolls). <br /><br />The Fund may engage in active and frequent trading of portfolio securities to achieve its primary investment strategies."

Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000018357_MemberInvestorAndInstitutional_Member,,,,,"Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in the Fund, as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment, may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. The following is a summary description of principal risks of investing in the Fund. <br /> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Credit Risk</b> &#8212; Credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of a security will not be able to make payments of interest and principal when due. Changes in an issuer&#8217;s credit rating or the market&#8217;s perception of an issuer&#8217;s creditworthiness may also affect the value of the Fund&#8217;s investment in that issuer.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Derivatives Risk</b> &#8212; The Fund's use of derivatives may reduce the Fund's returns and/or increase volatility. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, an index or a market to fluctuate significantly in price within a short time period. Derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund's use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the overall securities markets. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund to value accurately. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Recent legislation calls for new regulation of the derivatives markets. The extent and impact of the regulation is not yet known and may not be known for some time. New regulation may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, or may otherwise adversely affect the value or performance of derivatives.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Dollar Rolls Risk</b> &#8212; Dollar rolls involve the risk that the market value of the securities that the Fund is committed to buy may decline below the price of the securities the Fund has sold. These transactions may involve leverage.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Emerging Markets Risk</b> &#8212; Emerging markets are riskier than more developed markets because they tend to develop unevenly and may never fully develop. Investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative. Emerging markets are more likely to experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations, which adversely affect returns to U.S. investors. In addition, many emerging securities markets have far lower trading volumes and less liquidity than developed markets.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Extension Risk</b> &#8212; When interest rates rise, certain obligations will be paid off by the obligor more slowly than anticipated, causing the value of these securities to fall.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Foreign Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Foreign investments often involve special risks not present in U.S. investments that can increase the chances that the Fund will lose money. These risks include:</li></ul><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: -6px""> </p> <table style=""border-collapse: collapse"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%"">  <tr> <td width=""2%""> </td> <td valign=""top"" width=""3%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left"">The Fund generally holds its foreign securities and cash in foreign banks and securities depositories, which may be recently organized or new to the foreign custody business and may be subject to only limited or no regulatory oversight. </td></tr></table> <p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: -6px""> </p> <table style=""border-collapse: collapse"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%"">  <tr> <td width=""2%""> </td> <td valign=""top"" width=""3%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left"">Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the value of the Fund's portfolio. </td></tr></table> <p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: -6px""> </p> <table style=""border-collapse: collapse"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%"">  <tr> <td width=""2%""> </td> <td valign=""top"" width=""3%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left"">The economies of certain foreign markets may not compare favorably with the economy of the United States with respect to such issues as growth of gross national product, reinvestment of capital, resources and balance of payments position. </td></tr></table> <p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: -6px""> </p> <table style=""border-collapse: collapse"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%"">  <tr> <td width=""2%""> </td> <td valign=""top"" width=""3%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left"">The governments of certain countries may prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on foreign investments in their capital markets or in certain industries. </td></tr></table> <p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: -6px""> </p> <table style=""border-collapse: collapse"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%"">  <tr> <td width=""2%""> </td> <td valign=""top"" width=""3%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left"">Many foreign governments do not supervise and regulate stock exchanges, brokers and the sale of securities to the same extent as does the United States and may not have laws to protect investors that are comparable to U.S. securities laws.</td></tr></table> <p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: -6px""> </p> <table style=""border-collapse: collapse"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%"">  <tr> <td width=""2%""> </td> <td valign=""top"" width=""3%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left"">Settlement and clearance procedures in certain foreign markets may result in delays in payment for or delivery of securities not typically associated with settlement and clearance of U.S. investments. </td></tr></table><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>High Portfolio Turnover Risk</b> &#8212;  The Fund may engage in active and frequent trading of its portfolio securities. High portfolio turnover (more than 100%) may result in increased transaction costs to the Fund, including brokerage commissions, dealer mark-ups and other transaction costs on the sale of the securities and on reinvestment in other securities. The sale of Fund portfolio securities may result in the realization and/or distribution to shareholders of higher capital gains or losses as compared to a fund with less active trading policies. These effects of higher than normal portfolio turnover may adversely affect Fund performance. In addition, investment in mortgage dollar rolls and participation in TBA transactions may significantly increase the Fund's portfolio turnover rate. A TBA transaction is a method of trading mortgage-backed securities where the buyer and seller agree upon general trade parameters such as agency, settlement date, par amount, and price.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Interest Rate Risk</b> &#8212; Interest rate risk is the risk that prices of bonds and other fixed-income securities will increase as interest rates fall, and decrease as interest rates rise.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Leverage Risk</b> &#8212; Some transactions may give rise to a form of economic leverage. These transactions may include, among others, derivatives, and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. The use of leverage may cause the Fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations or to meet any required asset segregation requirements. Increases and decreases in the value of the Fund's portfolio will be magnified when the Fund uses leverage.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Liquidity Risk</b> &#8212; Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell. The Fund's investments in illiquid securities may reduce the returns of the Fund because it may be difficult to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. To the extent that the Fund's principal investment strategies involve derivatives or securities with substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have the greatest exposure to liquidity risk. Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, particularly during periods of market turmoil. Illiquid investments may be harder to value, especially in changing markets, and if the Fund is forced to sell these investments to meet redemption requests or for other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss. In addition, when there is illiquidity in the market for certain securities, the Fund, due to limitations on illiquid investments, may be subject to purchase and sale restrictions.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Market Risk and Selection Risk</b> &#8212; Market risk is the risk that one or more markets in which the Fund invests will go down in value, including the possibility that the markets will go down sharply and unpredictably. Selection risk is the risk that the securities selected by Fund management will underperform the markets, the relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds with similar investment objectives and investment strategies. This means you may lose money.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securities Risks</b> &#8212; Mortgage- and asset-backed securities represent interests in ""pools"" of mortgages or other assets, including consumer loans or receivables held in trust. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are subject to credit, interest rate, prepayment and extension risks. These securities also are subject to risk of default on the underlying mortgage or asset, particularly during periods of economic downturn. Small movements in interest rates (both increases and decreases) may quickly and significantly reduce the value of certain mortgage-backed securities.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Municipal Bonds Risk</b> &#8212; Municipal bonds are subject to interest rate, credit and market risk. The ability of an issuer to make payments could be affected by litigation, legislation or other political events or the bankruptcy of the issuer. Lower rated municipal bonds are subject to greater credit and market risk than higher quality municipal bonds. The market prices of residual interest bonds may be highly sensitive to changes in market rates and may decrease significantly when market rates increase.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Non-Investment Grade Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Although non-investment grade securities generally pay higher rates of interest than investment grade securities, non-investment grade securities are high risk investments that may cause income and principal losses for the Fund.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Prepayment Risk</b> &#8212; When interest rates fall, certain obligations will be paid off by the obligor more quickly than originally anticipated, and the Fund may have to invest the proceeds in securities with lower yields.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Repurchase Agreements, Purchase and Sale Contracts Risks</b> &#8212; If the other party to a repurchase agreement or purchase and sale contract defaults on its obligation under the agreement, the Fund may suffer delays and incur costs or lose money in exercising its rights under the agreement. If the seller fails to repurchase the security in either situation and the market value of the security declines, the Fund may lose money.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Reverse Repurchase Agreements Risk</b> &#8212; Reverse repurchase agreements involve the sale of securities held by the Fund with an agreement to repurchase the securities at an agreed-upon price, date and interest payment. Reverse repurchase agreements involve the risk that the other party may fail to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund could lose money if it is unable to recover the securities and the value of the collateral held by the Fund, including the value of the investments made with cash collateral, is less than the value of securities. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences to the Fund.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>U.S. Government Issuer Risk</b> &#8212; Treasury obligations may differ in their interest rates, maturities, times of issuance and other characteristics. Obligations of U.S. Government agencies and authorities are supported by varying degrees of credit but generally are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. No assurance can be given that the U.S. Government will provide financial support to its agencies and authorities if it is not obligated by law to do so.</li></ul>"

New regulation may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, or may otherwise adversely affect the value or performance of derivatives.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Dollar Rolls Risk</b> &#8212; Dollar rolls involve the risk that the market value of the securities that the Fund is committed to buy may decline below the price of the securities the Fund has sold.

High portfolio turnover (more than 100%) may result in increased transaction costs to the Fund, including brokerage commissions, dealer mark-ups and other transaction costs on the sale of the securities and on reinvestment in other securities. The sale of Fund portfolio securities may result in the realization and/or distribution to shareholders of higher capital gains or losses as compared to a fund with less active trading policies. These effects of higher than normal portfolio turnover may adversely affect Fund performance. In addition, investment in mortgage dollar rolls and participation in TBA transactions may significantly increase the Fund&#8217;s portfolio turnover rate. A TBA transaction is a method of trading mortgage-backed securities where the buyer and seller agree upon general trade parameters such as agency, settlement date, par amount, and price.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Inflation Indexed Bonds </b>&#8212; The principal value of an investment is not protected or otherwise guaranteed by virtue of the Fund&#8217;s investments in inflation-indexed bonds.</li></ul> <p style=""margin-top: -20px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 1%;"">Inflation-indexed bonds are fixed-income securities whose principal value is periodically adjusted according to the rate of inflation. If the index measuring inflation falls, the principal value of inflation-indexed bonds will be adjusted downward, and consequently the interest payable on these securities (calculated with respect to a smaller principal amount) will be reduced.</p> <p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: -8px;""> </p> <p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 1%;"">Repayment of the original bond principal upon maturity (as adjusted for inflation) is guaranteed in the case of U.S. Treasury inflation-indexed bonds.

Real interest rates are tied to the relationship between nominal interest rates and the rate of inflation. If nominal interest rates increase at a faster rate than inflation, real interest rates may rise, leading to a decrease in value of inflation-indexed bonds. Short-term increases in inflation may lead to a decline in value. Any increase in the principal amount of an inflation-indexed bond will be considered taxable ordinary income, even though investors do not receive their principal until maturity. </p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: -8px;""> </p> <p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 1%;"">Periodic adjustments for inflation to the principal amount of an inflation-indexed bond may give rise to original issue discount, which will be includable in the Fund&#8217;s gross income. Due to original issue discount, the Fund may be required to make annual distributions to shareholders that exceed the cash received, which may cause the Fund to liquidate certain investments when it is not advantageous to do so. Also, if the principal value of an inflation-indexed bond is adjusted downward due to deflation, amounts previously distributed in the taxable year may be characterized in some circumstances as a return of capital. </p><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Interest Rate Risk</b> &#8212; Interest rate risk is the risk that prices of bonds and other fixed-income securities will increase as interest rates fall, and decrease as interest rates rise.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Leverage Risk</b> &#8212; Some transactions may give rise to a form of economic leverage. These transactions may include, among others, derivatives, and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. The use of leverage may cause the Fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations or to meet any required asset segregation requirements. Increases and decreases in the value of the Fund&#8217;s portfolio will be magnified when the Fund uses leverage.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Liquidity Risk </b>&#8212; Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell. The Fund&#8217;s investments in illiquid securities may reduce the returns of the Fund because it may be difficult to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. To the extent that the Fund&#8217;s principal investment strategies involve derivatives or securities with substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have the greatest exposure to liquidity risk. Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, particularly during periods of market turmoil. Illiquid investments may be harder to value, especially in changing markets, and if the Fund is forced to sell these investments to meet redemption requests or for other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss. In addition, when there is illiquidity in the market for certain securities, the Fund, due to limitations on illiquid investments, may be subject to purchase and sale restrictions.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Market Risk and Selection Risk</b> &#8212; Market risk is the risk that one or more markets in which the Fund invests will go down in value, including the possibility that the markets will go down sharply and unpredictably. Selection risk is the risk that the securities selected by Fund management will underperform the markets, the relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds with similar investment objectives and investment strategies. This means you may lose money.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securities Risks </b>&#8212; Mortgage- and asset-backed securities represent interests in &#8220;pools&#8221; of mortgages or other assets, including consumer loans or receivables held in trust. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are subject to credit, interest rate, prepayment and extension risks. These securities also are subject to risk of default on the underlying mortgage or asset, particularly during periods of economic downturn. Small movements in interest rates (both increases and decreases) may quickly and significantly reduce the value of certain mortgage-backed securities.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Non-Diversification Risk</b> &#8212; The Fund is a non-diversified fund.

If the seller fails to repurchase the security in either situation and the market value of the security declines, the Fund may lose money.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Reverse Repurchase Agreements Risk </b>&#8212; Reverse repurchase agreements involve the sale of securities held by the Fund with an agreement to repurchase the securities at an agreed-upon price, date and interest payment. Reverse repurchase agreements involve the risk that the other party may fail to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund could lose money if it is unable to recover the securities and the value of the collateral held by the Fund, including the value of the investments made with cash collateral, is less than the value of securities. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences to the Fund.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>U.S. Government Issuer Risk</b> &#8212; Treasury obligations may differ in their interest rates, maturities, times of issuance and other characteristics. Obligations of U.S. Government agencies and authorities are supported by varying degrees of credit but generally are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. No assurance can be given that the U.S. Government will provide financial support to its agencies and authorities if it is not obligated by law to do so.</li></ul>"

Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000018352_MemberBlackRockShares_Member,,,,,"Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in the Fund, as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment, may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. The following is a summary description of principal risks of investing in the Fund.<ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Credit Risk</b> &#8212; Credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of a security will not be able to make payments of interest and principal when due. Changes in an issuer&#8217;s credit rating or the market&#8217;s perception of an issuer&#8217;s creditworthiness may also affect the value of the Fund&#8217;s investment in that issuer.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Deflation Risk</b> &#8212; Deflation risk is the possibility that prices throughout the economy decline over time &#8212; the opposite of inflation. If inflation is negative, the principal and income of an inflation-protected bond will decline and could result in losses for the Fund.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Derivatives Risk </b>&#8212; The Fund&#8217;s use of derivatives may reduce the Fund&#8217;s returns and/or increase volatility. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, an index or a market to fluctuate significantly in price within a short time period. Derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund&#8217;s use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the overall securities markets. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund to value accurately. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Recent legislation calls for new regulation of the derivatives markets. The extent and impact of the regulation is not yet known and may not be known for some time. New regulation may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, or may otherwise adversely affect the value or performance of derivatives.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Dollar Rolls Risk </b>&#8212; Dollar rolls involve the risk that the market value of the securities that the Fund is committed to buy may decline below the price of the securities the Fund has sold. These transactions may involve leverage.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Emerging Markets Risk </b>&#8212; Emerging markets are riskier than more developed markets because they tend to develop unevenly and may never fully develop. Investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative. Emerging markets are more likely to experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations, which adversely affect returns to U.S. investors. In addition, many emerging securities markets have far lower trading volumes and less liquidity than developed markets. </li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Extension Risk</b> &#8212; When interest rates rise, certain obligations will be paid off by the obligor more slowly than anticipated, causing the value of these securities to fall.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Foreign Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Foreign investments often involve special risks not present in U.S. investments that can increase the chances that the Fund will lose money. These risks include:</li></ul><div><table style=""border-collapse: collapse;"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%""> <tr><td width=""2%""> </td> <td valign=""top"" width=""3.5%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left""> <p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"">The Fund generally holds its foreign securities and cash in foreign banks and securities depositories, which may be recently organized or new to the foreign custody business and may be subject to only limited or no regulatory oversight. </p></td></tr></table></div><br/><div><table style=""border-collapse: collapse;"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%""> <tr><td width=""2%""> </td> <td valign=""top"" width=""3.5%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left""> <p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"">Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the value of the Fund&#8217;s portfolio. </p></td></tr></table></div><br/><div><table style=""border-collapse: collapse;"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%""> <tr><td width=""2%""> </td> <td valign=""top"" width=""3.5%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left""> <p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"">The economies of certain foreign markets may not compare favorably with the economy of the United States with respect to such issues as growth of gross national product, reinvestment of capital, resources and balance of payments position. </p></td></tr></table></div><br/><div><table style=""border-collapse: collapse;"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%""> <tr><td width=""2%""> </td> <td valign=""top"" width=""3.5%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left""> <p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"">The governments of certain countries may prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on foreign investments in their capital markets or in certain industries.</p></td></tr></table></div><br/><div><table style=""border-collapse: collapse;"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%""> <tr><td width=""2%""> </td> <td valign=""top"" width=""3.5%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left""> <p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"">Many foreign governments do not supervise and regulate stock exchanges, brokers and the sale of securities to the same extent as does the United States and may not have laws to protect investors that are comparable to U.S. securities laws. </p></td></tr></table></div><br/><div><table style=""border-collapse: collapse;"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%""> <tr><td width=""2%""> </td> <td valign=""top"" width=""3.5%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left""> <p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"">Settlement and clearance procedures in certain foreign markets may result in delays in payment for or delivery of securities not typically associated with settlement and clearance of U.S. investments. </p></td></tr></table></div><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>High Portfolio Turnover Risk </b>&#8212; The Fund may engage in active and frequent trading of its portfolio securities. High portfolio turnover (more than 100%) may result in increased transaction costs to the Fund, including brokerage commissions, dealer mark-ups and other transaction costs on the sale of the securities and on reinvestment in other securities. The sale of Fund portfolio securities may result in the realization and/or distribution to shareholders of higher capital gains or losses as compared to a fund with less active trading policies. These effects of higher than normal portfolio turnover may adversely affect Fund performance. In addition, investment in mortgage dollar rolls and participation in TBA transactions may significantly increase the Fund&#8217;s portfolio turnover rate. A TBA transaction is a method of trading mortgage-backed securities where the buyer and seller agree upon general trade parameters such as agency, settlement date, par amount, and price.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""> <b>Inflation Indexed Bonds </b>&#8212; The principal value of an investment is not protected or otherwise guaranteed by virtue of the Fund&#8217;s investments in inflation-indexed bonds.<br/><br/>Inflation-indexed bonds are fixed-income securities whose principal value is periodically adjusted according to the rate of inflation. If the index measuring inflation falls, the principal value of inflation-indexed bonds will be adjusted downward, and consequently the interest payable on these securities (calculated with respect to a smaller principal amount) will be reduced.<br/><br/>Repayment of the original bond principal upon maturity (as adjusted for inflation) is guaranteed in the case of U.S. Treasury inflation-indexed bonds. For bonds that do not provide a similar guarantee, the adjusted principal value of the bond repaid at maturity may be less than the original principal value.<br/><br/>The value of inflation-indexed bonds is expected to change in response to changes in real interest rates. Real interest rates are tied to the relationship between nominal interest rates and the rate of inflation. If nominal interest rates increase at a faster rate than inflation, real interest rates may rise, leading to a decrease in value of inflation-indexed bonds. Short-term increases in inflation may lead to a decline in value. Any increase in the principal amount of an inflation-indexed bond will be considered taxable ordinary income, even though investors do not receive their principal until maturity. <br/><br/>Periodic adjustments for inflation to the principal amount of an inflation-indexed bond may give rise to original issue discount, which will be includable in the Fund&#8217;s gross income. Due to original issue discount, the Fund may be required to make annual distributions to shareholders that exceed the cash received, which may cause the Fund to liquidate certain investments when it is not advantageous to do so. Also, if the principal value of an inflation-indexed bond is adjusted downward due to deflation, amounts previously distributed in the taxable year may be characterized in some circumstances as a return of capital. </li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Interest Rate Risk</b> &#8212; Interest rate risk is the risk that prices of bonds and other fixed-income securities will increase as interest rates fall, and decrease as interest rates rise.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Leverage Risk </b>&#8212; Some transactions may give rise to a form of economic leverage. These transactions may include, among others, derivatives, and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. The use of leverage may cause the Fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations or to meet any required asset segregation requirements. Increases and decreases in the value of the Fund&#8217;s portfolio will be magnified when the Fund uses leverage. </li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""> <b>Liquidity Risk </b>&#8212; Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell. The Fund&#8217;s investments in illiquid securities may reduce the returns of the Fund because it may be difficult to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. To the extent that the Fund&#8217;s principal investment strategies involve derivatives or securities with substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have the greatest exposure to liquidity risk. Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, particularly during periods of market turmoil. Illiquid investments may be harder to value, especially in changing markets, and if the Fund is forced to sell these investments to meet redemption requests or for other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss. In addition, when there is illiquidity in the market for certain securities, the Fund, due to limitations on illiquid investments, may be subject to purchase and sale restrictions.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Market Risk and Selection Risk </b>&#8212; Market risk is the risk that one or more markets in which the Fund invests will go down in value, including the possibility that the markets will go down sharply and unpredictably. Selection risk is the risk that the securities selected by Fund management will underperform the markets, the relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds with similar investment objectives and investment strategies. This means you may lose money.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""> <b>Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securities Risks </b>&#8212; Mortgage- and asset-backed securities represent interests in &#8220;pools&#8221; of mortgages or other assets, including consumer loans or receivables held in trust. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are subject to credit, interest rate, prepayment and extension risks. These securities also are subject to risk of default on the underlying mortgage or asset, particularly during periods of economic downturn. Small movements in interest rates (both increases and decreases) may quickly and significantly reduce the value of certain mortgage-backed securities.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Non-Diversification Risk </b>&#8212; The Fund is a non-diversified fund. Because the Fund may invest in securities of a smaller number of issuers, it may be more exposed to the risks associated with and developments affecting an individual issuer than a fund that invests more widely.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Non-Investment Grade Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Although non-investment grade securities generally pay higher rates of interest than investment grade securities, non-investment grade securities are high risk investments that may cause income and principal losses for the Fund.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Prepayment Risk </b>&#8212; When interest rates fall, certain obligations will be paid off by the obligor more quickly than originally anticipated, and the Fund may have to invest the proceeds in securities with lower yields.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Repurchase Agreements, Purchase and Sale Contracts Risks</b> &#8212; If the other party to a repurchase agreement or purchase and sale contract defaults on its obligation under the agreement, the Fund may suffer delays and incur costs or lose money in exercising its rights under the agreement. If the seller fails to repurchase the security in either situation and the market value of the security declines, the Fund may lose money.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Reverse Repurchase Agreements Risk </b>&#8212; Reverse repurchase agreements involve the sale of securities held by the Fund with an agreement to repurchase the securities at an agreed-upon price, date and interest payment. Reverse repurchase agreements involve the risk that the other party may fail to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund could lose money if it is unable to recover the securities and the value of the collateral held by the Fund, including the value of the investments made with cash collateral, is less than the value of securities. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences to the Fund.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>U.S. Government Issuer Risk</b> &#8212; Treasury obligations may differ in their interest rates, maturities, times of issuance and other characteristics. Obligations of U.S. Government agencies and authorities are supported by varying degrees of credit but generally are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. No assurance can be given that the U.S. Government will provide financial support to its agencies and authorities if it is not obligated by law to do so.</li></ul>"

Strategy Narrative [Text Block],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000018357_MemberClassRshares_Member,,,,,"Under normal circumstances, the Fund invests at least 80% of its assets in bonds and maintains an average portfolio duration that is within &#177;20% of the duration of the Barclays Long Government/Credit Index (the benchmark).<br/><br/>Fund management evaluates sectors of the U.S. and non-U.S. bond market and individual securities within these sectors. The Fund selects bonds from several sectors including: U.S. Treasuries and agency securities, commercial  and residential mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations (&#8220;CMOs&#8221;), pass-throughs, asset-backed securities, corporate bonds and taxable and tax-exempt municipal bonds. The Fund may also invest in preferred stock.<br/><br/>The Fund invests primarily in dollar-denominated investment grade bonds, but may invest up to 20% of its assets in any combination of non-investment grade bonds (high yield or junk bonds), non-dollar denominated bonds and bonds of emerging market issuers. The Fund&#8217;s investment in non-dollar denominated bonds may be on a currency hedged or unhedged basis. Non-investment grade bonds acquired by the Fund will generally be in the lower rating categories of the major rating agencies (BB or lower by Standard & Poor&#8217;s (&#8220;S&P&#8221;) or Ba or lower by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, Inc. (&#8220;Moody&#8217;s&#8221;)) or will be determined by the management team to be of similar quality. The Fund may invest in securities rated in the category C and above or determined by the management team to be of comparable quality. Split rated bonds will be considered to have the higher credit rating. Split rated bonds are bonds that receive different ratings from two or more rating agencies.<br/><br/>The Fund may buy or sell options or futures on a security or an index of securities, or enter into credit default swaps and interest rate or foreign currency transactions, including swaps (collectively, commonly known as derivatives). The Fund may seek to obtain market exposure to the securities in which it primarily invests by entering into a series of purchase and sale contracts or by using other investment techniques (such as reverse repurchase agreements or dollar rolls).<br/><br/>The Fund may engage in active and frequent trading of portfolio securities to achieve its primary investment strategies."
Risk [Heading],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000018357_MemberClassRshares_Member,,,,,<b>Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund </b>
Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000018357_MemberClassRshares_Member,,,,,"Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in the Fund, as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment, may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. The following is a summary description of principal risks of investing in the Fund.  <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""> <b>Credit Risk</b> &#8212; Credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of a security will not be able to make payments of interest and principal when due. Changes in an issuer&#8217;s credit rating or the market&#8217;s perception of an issuer&#8217;s creditworthiness may also affect the value of the Fund&#8217;s investment in that issuer. </li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""> <b>Derivatives Risk</b> &#8212; The Fund&#8217;s use of derivatives may reduce the Fund&#8217;s returns and/or increase volatility. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, an index or a market to fluctuate significantly in price within a short time period. Derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund&#8217;s use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the overall securities markets. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund to value accurately. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Recent legislation calls for new regulation of the derivatives markets. The extent and impact of the regulation is not yet known and may not be known for some time. New regulation may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, or may otherwise adversely affect the value or performance of derivatives. </li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""> <b>Dollar Rolls Risk</b> &#8212; Dollar rolls involve the risk that the market value of the securities that the Fund is committed to buy may decline below the price of the securities the Fund has sold. These transactions may involve leverage. </li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""> <b>Emerging Markets Risk</b> &#8212; Emerging markets are riskier than more developed markets because they tend to develop unevenly and may never fully develop. Investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative. Emerging markets are more likely to experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations, which adversely affect returns to U.S. investors. In addition, many emerging securities markets have far lower trading volumes and less liquidity than developed markets. </li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""> <b>Extension Risk</b> &#8212; When interest rates rise, certain obligations will be paid off by the obligor more slowly than anticipated, causing the value of these securities to fall. </li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Foreign Securities Risk &#8212; </b>Foreign investments often involve special risks not present in U.S. investments that can increase the chances that the Fund will lose money. These risks include:</li></ul><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: -6px""> </p> <table style=""border-collapse: collapse"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%"">  <tr> <td width=""2%""> </td> <td valign=""top"" width=""3%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left"">The Fund generally holds its foreign securities and cash in foreign banks and securities depositories, which may be recently organized or new to the foreign custody business and may be subject to only limited or no regulatory oversight. </td></tr></table> <p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: -6px""> </p> <table style=""border-collapse: collapse"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%"">  <tr> <td width=""2%""> </td> <td valign=""top"" width=""3%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left"">Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the value of the Fund's portfolio. </td></tr></table> <p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: -6px""> </p> <table style=""border-collapse: collapse"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%"">  <tr> <td width=""2%""> </td> <td valign=""top"" width=""3%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left"">The economies of certain foreign markets may not compare favorably with the economy of the United States with respect to such issues as growth of gross national product, reinvestment of capital, resources and balance of payments position. </td></tr></table> <p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: -6px""> </p> <table style=""border-collapse: collapse"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%"">  <tr> <td width=""2%""> </td> <td valign=""top"" width=""3%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left"">The governments of certain countries may prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on foreign investments in their capital markets or in certain industries. </td></tr></table> <p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: -6px""> </p> <table style=""border-collapse: collapse"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%"">  <tr> <td width=""2%""> </td> <td valign=""top"" width=""3%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left"">Many foreign governments do not supervise and regulate stock exchanges, brokers and the sale of securities to the same extent as does the United States and may not have laws to protect investors that are comparable to U.S. securities laws.   </td></tr></table> <p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: -6px""> </p> <table style=""border-collapse: collapse"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%"">  <tr> <td width=""2%""> </td> <td valign=""top"" width=""3%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left"">Settlement and clearance procedures in certain foreign markets may result in delays in payment for or delivery of securities not typically associated with settlement and clearance of U.S. investments. </td></tr></table><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>High Portfolio Turnover Risk</b> &#8212; The Fund may engage in active and frequent trading of its portfolio securities. High portfolio turnover (more than 100%) may result in increased transaction costs to the Fund, including brokerage commissions, dealer mark-ups and other transaction costs on the sale of the securities and on reinvestment in other securities. The sale of Fund portfolio securities may result in the realization and/or distribution to shareholders of higher capital gains or losses as compared to a fund with less active trading policies. These effects of higher than normal portfolio turnover may adversely affect Fund performance. In addition, investment in mortgage dollar rolls and participation in TBA transactions may significantly increase the Fund&#8217;s portfolio turnover rate. A TBA transaction is a method of trading mortgage-backed securities where the buyer and seller agree upon general trade parameters such as agency, settlement date, par amount, and price. </li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Interest Rate Risk</b> &#8212; Interest rate risk is the risk that prices of bonds and other fixed-income securities will increase as interest rates fall, and decrease as interest rates rise. </li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Leverage Risk</b> &#8212; Some transactions may give rise to a form of economic leverage. These transactions may include, among others, derivatives, and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. The use of leverage may cause the Fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations or to meet any required asset segregation requirements. Increases and decreases in the value of the Fund&#8217;s portfolio will be magnified when the Fund uses leverage. </li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Liquidity Risk</b> &#8212; Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell. The Fund&#8217;s investments in illiquid securities may reduce the returns of the Fund because it may be difficult to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. To the extent that the Fund&#8217;s principal investment strategies involve derivatives or securities with substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have the greatest exposure to liquidity risk. Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, particularly during periods of market turmoil. Illiquid investments may be harder to value, especially in changing markets, and if the Fund is forced to sell these investments to meet redemption requests or for other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss. In addition, when there is illiquidity in the market for certain securities, the Fund, due to limitations on illiquid investments, may be subject to purchase and sale restrictions. </li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Market Risk and Selection Risk </b>&#8212; Market risk is the risk that one or more markets in which the Fund invests will go down in value, including the possibility that the markets will go down sharply and unpredictably. Selection risk is the risk that the securities selected by Fund management will underperform the markets, the relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds with similar investment objectives and investment strategies. This means you may lose money. </li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securities Risks</b> &#8212; Mortgage- and asset-backed securities represent interests in &#8220;pools&#8221; of mortgages or other assets, including consumer loans or receivables held in trust. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are subject to credit, interest rate, prepayment and extension risks. These securities also are subject to risk of default on the underlying mortgage or asset, particularly during periods of economic downturn. Small movements in interest rates (both increases and decreases) may quickly and significantly reduce the value of certain mortgage-backed securities. </li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Municipal Bonds Risk</b> &#8212; Municipal bonds are subject to interest rate, credit and market risk. The ability of an issuer to make payments could be affected by litigation, legislation or other political events or the bankruptcy of the issuer. Lower rated municipal bonds are subject to greater credit and market risk than higher quality municipal bonds. The market prices of residual interest bonds may be highly sensitive to changes in market rates and may decrease significantly when market rates increase.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Non-Investment Grade Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Although non-investment grade securities generally pay higher rates of interest than investment grade securities, non-investment grade securities are high risk investments that may cause income and principal losses for the Fund.</li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Prepayment Risk</b> &#8212; When interest rates fall, certain obligations will be paid off by the obligor more quickly than originally anticipated, and the Fund may have to invest the proceeds in securities with lower yields. </li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Repurchase Agreements, Purchase and Sale Contracts Risks</b> &#8212; If the other party to a repurchase agreement or purchase and sale contract defaults on its obligation under the agreement, the Fund may suffer delays and incur  costs or lose money in exercising its rights under the agreement. If the seller fails to repurchase the security in either situation and the market value of the security declines, the Fund may lose money. </li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>Reverse Repurchase Agreements Risk</b> &#8212; Reverse repurchase agreements involve the sale of securities held by the Fund with an agreement to repurchase the securities at an agreed-upon price, date and interest payment. Reverse repurchase agreements involve the risk that the other party may fail to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund could lose money if it is unable to recover the securities and the value of the collateral held by the Fund, including the value of the investments made with cash collateral, is less than the value of securities. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences to the Fund. </li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><b>U.S. Government Issuer Risk</b> &#8212; Treasury obligations may differ in their interest rates, maturities, times of issuance and other characteristics. Obligations of U.S. Government agencies and authorities are supported by varying degrees of credit but generally are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. No assurance can be given that the U.S. Government will provide financial support to its agencies and authorities if it is not obligated by law to do so. </li></ul>"

Performance Narrative [Text Block],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000018357_MemberClassRshares_Member,,,,,"Since Class R Shares of the Long Duration Bond Portfolio have no performance history, the chart and table below give you a picture of the Fund&#8217;s long-term performance for Investor A Shares. Although the chart and table show returns for the Investor A Shares which are not offered in this Prospectus, the Investor A Shares would have substantially similar annual returns as the Class R Shares offered in this Prospectus because the Investor A Shares and the Class R Shares are invested in the same portfolio of securities and the annual returns would differ only to the extent that the Investor A Shares and the Class R Shares do not have the same expenses. The actual return of Class R Shares would have been lower than that of Investor A Shares because Class R Shares have higher expenses than Investor A Shares. Investor A Shares of the Fund are estimated to have expenses of 0.91% of average daily net assets (after waivers and reimbursements) for the current fiscal year and Class R Shares of the Fund are expected to have expenses of 1.33% of average daily net assets (after waivers and reimbursements) for the current fiscal year.<br/><br/>The information shows you how the Fund&#8217;s performance has varied year by year and provides some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund. The table compares the Fund&#8217;s performance to that of the Barclays Long Government/Credit Index. As with all such investments, past performance (before and after taxes) is not an indication of future results. Sales charges are not reflected in the bar chart.
