Strategy Narrative [Text Block],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004270_MemberInvestorInstitutional_Member,,,,,"The Fund pursues its investment objective by seeking to match the total return performance of the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index, which is composed of approximately 8,000 fixed-income securities. The fixed-income securities that comprise the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index include U.S. government securities and corporate bonds, as well as mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and commercial mortgage-backed securities. All securities in the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index are investment-grade. The Fund maintains a weighted average maturity consistent with that of the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index, which generally ranges between 5 and 10 years. The Fund invests in a representative sample of these securities. Securities are selected for investment by the Fund in accordance with their relative proportion within the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index as well as based on credit quality, issuer sector, maturity structure, coupon rates and callability, among other factors. BFA, the investment adviser to the Master Portfolio in which the Fund invests, considers investments that provide substantially similar exposure to securities in the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index to be investments comprising the Fund&#8217;s benchmark index.<br/><br/>The Fund is managed by determining which securities are to be purchased or sold to reflect, to the extent feasible, the investment characteristics of its benchmark index. Under normal circumstances, at least 90% of the value of the Fund&#8217;s assets, plus the amount of any borrowing for investment purposes, is invested in securities comprising the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index, which, for the Fund, are considered bonds.<br/><br/>The Fund is a &#8220;feeder&#8221; fund that invests all of its investable assets in the Master Portfolio of MIP, which has the same investment objective and strategies as the Fund. All investments are made at the Master Portfolio level. This structure is sometimes called a &#8220;master/feeder&#8221; structure. The Fund&#8217;s investment results will correspond directly to the investment results of the Master Portfolio. For simplicity, the prospectus uses the name of the Fund or the term &#8220;Fund&#8221; (as applicable) to include the Master Portfolio."

Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004270_MemberInvestorInstitutional_Member,,,,,"Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in the Fund, as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment, may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. The following is a summary description of principal risks of investing in the Fund.<ul type=""square""><li><b>Credit Risk</b> &#8212; Credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of a security will not be able to make payments of interest and principal when due. Changes in an issuer&#8217;s credit rating or the market&#8217;s perception of an issuer&#8217;s creditworthiness may also affect the value of the Fund&#8217;s investment in that issuer.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Debt Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Debt securities, such as bonds, involve credit risk. Debt securities are also subject to interest rate risk.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Extension Risk</b> &#8212; When interest rates rise, certain obligations will be paid off by the obligor more slowly than anticipated, causing the value of these securities to fall.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>High Portfolio Turnover Risk</b> &#8212; The Fund may engage in active and frequent trading of its portfolio securities. High portfolio turnover (more than 100%) may result in increased transaction costs to the Fund, including brokerage commissions, dealer mark-ups and other transaction costs on the sale of the securities and on reinvestment in other securities. The sale of Fund portfolio securities may result in the realization and/or distribution to shareholders of higher capital gains or losses as compared to a fund with less active trading policies. These effects of higher than normal portfolio turnover may adversely affect Fund performance.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Index Fund Risk</b> &#8212; An index fund has operating and other expenses while an index does not. As a result, while the Fund will attempt to track the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index as closely as possible, it will tend to underperform the index to some degree over time. If an index fund is properly correlated to its stated index, the fund will perform poorly when the index performs poorly.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Interest Rate Risk</b> &#8212; Interest rate risk is the risk that prices of bonds and other fixed-income securities will increase as interest rates fall, and decrease as interest rates rise.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Market Risk and Selection Risk</b> &#8212; Market risk is the risk that one or more markets in which the Fund invests will go down in value, including the possibility that the markets will go down sharply and unpredictably. Selection risk is the risk that the securities selected by Fund management will underperform the markets, the relevant indexes or the securities selected by other funds with similar investment objectives and investment strategies. This means you may lose money.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securities Risks</b> &#8212; Mortgage- and asset-backed securities represent interests in &#8220;pools&#8221; of mortgages or other assets, including consumer loans or receivables held in trust. Mortgage- and asset- backed securities are subject to credit, interest rate, prepayment and extension risks. These securities also are subject to risk of default on the underlying mortgage or asset, particularly during periods of economic downturn. Small movements in interest rates (both increases and decreases) may quickly and significantly reduce the value of certain mortgage-backed securities.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Prepayment Risk</b> &#8212; When interest rates fall, certain obligations will be paid off by the obligor more quickly than originally anticipated, and the Fund may have to invest the proceeds in securities with lower yields.</li></ul>"

Investor A and Institutional Shares of the Fund commenced operations on March 31, 2011.

The performance of the Fund&#8217;s Class K Shares would be substantially similar to the performance of the Investor A and Institutional Shares because the Class K, Investor A and Institutional Shares are invested in the same portfolio of securities and performance would differ only to the extent that the share classes have different expenses.

A higher portfolio turnover may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the Fund&#8217;s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Master Portfolio&#8217;s portfolio turnover rate was 436% of the average value of its portfolio."

Strategy Narrative [Text Block],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004270_MemberClassK_Member,,,,,"The Fund pursues its investment objective by seeking to match the total return performance of the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index, which is composed of approximately 8,000 fixed-income securities. The fixed-income securities that comprise the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index include U.S. government securities and corporate bonds, as well as mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and commercial mortgage-backed securities. All securities in the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index are investment grade. The Fund maintains a weighted average maturity consistent with that of the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index, which generally ranges between 5 and 10 years. The Fund invests in a representative sample of these securities. Securities are selected for investment by the Fund in accordance with their relative proportion within the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index as well as based on credit quality, issuer sector, maturity structure, coupon rates and callability, among other factors. BFA, the investment adviser to the Master Portfolio in which the Fund invests, considers investments that provide substantially similar exposure to securities in the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index to be investments comprising the Fund&#8217;s benchmark index.<br/><br/>The Fund is managed by determining which securities are to be purchased or sold to reflect, to the extent feasible, the investment characteristics of its benchmark index. Under normal circumstances, at least 90% of the value of the Fund&#8217;s assets, plus the amount of any borrowing for investment purposes, is invested in securities comprising the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index, which, for the Fund, are considered bonds.<br/><br/>The Fund is a &#8220;feeder&#8221; fund that invests all of its investable assets in the Master Portfolio of MIP, which has the same investment objective and strategies as the Fund. All investments are made at the Master Portfolio level. This structure is sometimes called a &#8220;master/feeder&#8221; structure. The Fund&#8217;s investment results will correspond directly to the investment results of the Master Portfolio. For simplicity, the prospectus uses the name of the Fund or the term &#8220;Fund&#8221; (as applicable) to include the Master Portfolio."

Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004270_MemberClassK_Member,,,,,"Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in the Fund, as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment, may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. The following is a summary description of principal risks of investing in the Fund.<ul type=""square""><li><b>Credit Risk</b> &#8212; Credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of a security will not be able to make payments of interest and principal when due. Changes in an issuer&#8217;s credit rating or the market&#8217;s perception of an issuer&#8217;s creditworthiness may also affect the value of the Fund&#8217;s investment in that issuer.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Debt Securities</b> Risk &#8212; Debt securities, such as bonds, involve credit risk. Debt securities are also subject to interest rate risk.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Extension Risk</b> &#8212; When interest rates rise, certain obligations will be paid off by the obligor more slowly than anticipated, causing the value of these securities to fall.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>High Portfolio Turnover Risk</b> &#8212; The Fund may engage in active and frequent trading of its portfolio securities. High portfolio turnover (more than 100%) may result in increased transaction costs to the Fund, including brokerage commissions, dealer mark-ups and other transaction costs on the sale of the securities and on reinvestment in other securities. The sale of Fund portfolio securities may result in the realization and/or distribution to shareholders of higher capital gains or losses as compared to a fund with less active trading policies. These effects of higher than normal portfolio turnover may adversely affect Fund performance.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Index Fund Risk</b> &#8212; An index fund has operating and other expenses while an index does not. As a result, while the Fund will attempt to track the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index as closely as possible, it will tend to underperform the index to some degree over time. If an index fund is properly correlated to its stated index, the fund will perform poorly when the index performs poorly.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Interest Rate Risk</b> &#8212; Interest rate risk is the risk that prices of bonds and other fixed-income securities will increase as interest rates fall, and decrease as interest rates rise.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Market Risk and Selection Risk</b> &#8212; Market risk is the risk that one or more markets in which the Fund invests will go down in value, including the possibility that the markets will go down sharply and unpredictably. Selection risk is the risk that the securities selected by Fund management will underperform the markets, the relevant indexes or the securities selected by other funds with similar investment objectives and investment strategies. This means you may lose money.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securities Risks</b> &#8212; Mortgage- and asset-backed securities represent interests in &#8220;pools&#8221; of mortgages or other assets, including consumer loans or receivables held in trust. Mortgage- and asset- backed securities are subject to credit, interest rate, prepayment and extension risks. These securities also are subject to risk of default on the underlying mortgage or asset, particularly during periods of economic downturn. Small movements in interest rates (both increases and decreases) may quickly and significantly reduce the value of certain mortgage-backed securities.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Prepayment Risk</b> &#8212; When interest rates fall, certain obligations will be paid off by the obligor more quickly than originally anticipated, and the Fund may have to invest the proceeds in securities with lower yields.</li></ul>"
