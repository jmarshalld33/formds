Strategy [Heading],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000030675_Member,,,,,<b>Principal Investment Strategies of the Fund </b>
Strategy Narrative [Text Block],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000030675_Member,,,,,"The Fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing at least 80% of its total assets in equity securities of companies domiciled, or exercising the predominant part of their economic activity, in China, including its special administrative regions such as Hong Kong, or in instruments with similar economic characteristics. Equity securities include common stock, preferred stock, securities convertible into common stock or securities or other instruments whose price is linked to the value of common stocks. A company may be deemed to exercise a predominant part of its activity in China if (i) shares of such company are principally traded in China, (ii) such company derives at least 50% of its revenues or profits from China, or (iii) such company has at least 50% of its assets in China.<br/><br/>Fund management anticipates that at least 70% of the Fund&#8217;s total assets will be invested in shares designated H shares or Red Chip shares, both of which are listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. H shares are issued by companies that are incorporated in China. Red Chip shares are issued by companies based in China but incorporated internationally.<br/><br/>The Fund also invests in securities listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges. These securities are divided into two classes of shares: A shares, ownership of which is restricted to Chinese investors and to certain foreign investors under the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor structure, and B shares, which may be owned by both Chinese and foreign investors. The Fund&#8217;s exposure to the A shares market will be effected through investments in participation notes or other structured or derivative instruments that are designed to replicate, or otherwise provide exposure to, the performance of A shares of Chinese companies. The Fund expects to gain exposure to the B shares market through direct investments in securities listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges.<br/><br/>The Fund is a non-diversified fund, which means that it can invest more of its assets in fewer companies than a diversified fund.<br/><br/>The Fund has a value orientation, although Fund management recognizes that this style will underperform at certain periods in the cycle and has the flexibility to adjust style risk accordingly. Fund management is based on fundamental analysis, although it makes use of quantitative inputs. The fundamental analysis focuses on company specifics, such as valuation, earnings sustainability, earnings revision and cash flow analysis. The quantitative inputs include a multi-factor screen and price action criteria."
Risk [Heading],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000030675_Member,,,,,<b>Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund </b>
Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000030675_Member,,,,,"Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in the Fund, as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment, may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. The following is a summary description of certain risks of investing in the Fund.<ul type=""square""><li><b>Chinese Investment Risk</b> &#8212; China is a developing market and demonstrates significantly higher volatility from time to time in comparison to developed markets. Significant price swings may disrupt the investment strategy of the Fund. Over the past 30 years, the Chinese government has implemented economic reforms and reforms of market practices emphasizing the utilization of market forces in the development of the Chinese economy. However, Chinese markets generally continue to experience inefficiency, volatility and pricing anomalies resulting from governmental influence, a lack of publicly available information, higher level of control over foreign exchange, a less efficient allocation of resources and/or political and social instability. Internal social unrest or confrontations with other neighboring countries, including military conflicts in response to such events, may also disrupt economic development in China and result in a greater risk of currency fluctuations, currency convertibility, interest rate fluctuations and higher rates of inflation.<br/><br/>Hong Kong. Since Hong Kong reverted to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, it has been governed by a quasi-constitution known as the &#8220;Basic Law,&#8221; which guarantees a high degree of autonomy in certain matters until 2047, while defense and foreign affairs are the responsibility of the central government in Beijing. Attempts by China to exert control over Hong Kong&#8217;s economic, political or legal structures or its existing social policy, could negatively affect investor confidence in Hong Kong, thereby negatively affecting markets and business performance and adversely affecting the Fund&#8217;s investments. Hong Kong&#8217;s primary economic sectors, such as real estate, tourism, retail and finance, are volatile. The economy of Hong Kong may be significantly affected by developments in China and elsewhere in Asia and the United States, including decreasing imports or changes in the trade policies of Hong Kong&#8217;s trading partners.<br/><br/>Tax. The tax laws and regulations in the People&#8217;s Republic of China (the &#8220;PRC&#8221;) are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. The interpretation, applicability and enforcement of such laws by PRC tax authorities are not as consistent and transparent as those of more developed nations, and may vary over time and from region to region. The application and enforcement of the PRC tax rules could have a significant adverse effect on the Fund and its investors, particularly in relation to capital gains withholding tax imposed upon non-residents.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Depositary Receipts Risk</b> &#8212; The issuers of unsponsored depositary receipts are not obligated to disclose information that is, in the United States, considered material. Therefore, there may be less information available regarding these issuers and there may not be a correlation between such information and the market value of the depositary receipts. Depositary receipts are generally subject to the same risks as the foreign securities that they evidence or into which they may be converted.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Derivatives Risk</b> &#8212; The Fund&#8217;s use of derivatives may reduce the Fund&#8217;s returns and/or increase volatility. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, an index or a market to fluctuate significantly in price within a short time period. Derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund&#8217;s use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the overall securities markets. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund to value accurately. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Recent legislation calls for new regulation of the derivatives markets. The extent and impact of the regulation is not yet known and may not be known for some time. New regulation may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, or may otherwise adversely affect the value or performance of derivatives.<br/><br/>Risks of Investing in Participation Notes &#8212; Investing in participation notes involves the same risks associated with a direct investment in the shares of the companies the notes seek to replicate. However, the performance results of participation notes will not replicate exactly the performance of the issuers or markets that the notes seek to replicate due to transaction costs and other expenses. In addition, participation notes are subject to counterparty risk. Participation notes may be considered illiquid.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Emerging Markets Risk</b> &#8212; Emerging markets are riskier than more developed markets because they tend to develop unevenly and may never fully develop. Investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative. Emerging markets are more likely to experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations, which adversely affect returns to U.S. investors. In addition, many emerging securities markets have far lower trading volumes and less liquidity than developed markets.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Equity Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Stock markets are volatile. The prices of equity securities fluctuate based on changes in a company&#8217;s financial condition and overall market and economic conditions.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Foreign Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Foreign investments often involve special risks not present in U.S. investments that can increase the chances that the Fund will lose money. These risks include:<br/><br/>&#8212; The Fund generally holds its foreign securities and cash in foreign banks and securities depositories, which may be recently organized or new to the foreign custody business and may be subject to only limited or no regulatory oversight.<br/><br/>&#8212; Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the value of the Fund&#8217;s portfolio.<br/><br/>&#8212; The economies of certain foreign markets may not compare favorably with the economy of the United States with respect to such issues as growth of gross national product, reinvestment of capital, resources and balance of payments position.<br/><br/>&#8212; The governments of certain countries may prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on foreign investments in their capital markets or in certain industries.<br/><br/>&#8212; Many foreign governments do not supervise and regulate stock exchanges, brokers and the sale of securities to the same extent as does the United States and may not have laws to protect investors that are comparable to U.S. securities laws.<br/><br/>&#8212; Settlement and clearance procedures in certain foreign markets may result in delays in payment for or delivery of securities not typically associated with settlement and clearance of U.S. investments.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Geographic Concentration Risk</b> &#8212; The Fund will invest primarily in securities of companies domiciled, or exercising the predominant part of their economic activity, in China. Because the Fund concentrates its investments in this manner, it assumes the risk that economic, political and social conditions in China will have a significant impact on the Fund&#8217;s investment performance and that the Fund&#8217;s performance may be more volatile than the performance of more geographically diversified funds.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Investment Style Risk</b> &#8212; Under certain market conditions, value investments have performed better during periods of economic recovery. Therefore, this investment style may over time go in and out of favor. At times when the investment style used by the Fund is out of favor, the Fund may underperform other equity funds that use different investment styles.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Leverage Risk</b> &#8212; Some transactions may give rise to a form of economic leverage. These transactions may include, among others, derivatives, and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. The use of leverage may cause the Fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations or to meet any required asset segregation requirements. Increases and decreases in the value of the Fund&#8217;s portfolio will be magnified when the Fund uses leverage.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Market Risk and Selection Risk</b> &#8212; Market risk is the risk that one or more markets in which the Fund invests will go down in value, including the possibility that the markets will go down sharply and unpredictably. Selection risk is the risk that the securities selected by Fund management will underperform the markets, the relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds with similar investment objectives and investment strategies. This means you may lose money.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Non-Diversification Risk</b> &#8212; The Fund is a non-diversified fund. Because the Fund may invest in securities of a smaller number of issuers, it may be more exposed to the risks associated with and developments affecting an individual issuer than a fund that invests more widely.</li></ul>"
