Strategy Narrative [Text Block],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004500_MemberSchwabAmtTaxFreeMoneyFund_Member,,,,,"<b>To pursue its goal, the fund invests in money market securities from states and municipal agencies around the country and from U.S. territories and possessions.</b> These securities may include general obligation issues, which typically are backed by the issuer&#8217;s ability to levy taxes; revenue bonds, which typically are backed by a stream of revenue from a given source, such as a public water system or hospital; municipal commercial paper and municipal notes; and municipal leases, which may be used to finance construction or equipment purchases. The fund may invest more than 25% of its total assets in municipal securities financing similar projects such as those relating to education, health care, transportation, utilities, industrial development and housing. Under normal circumstances, the fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets in municipal money market securities whose interest is exempt from federal income tax, including the federal alternative minimum tax (AMT). The fund does not currently intend to invest in any municipal securities whose interest is subject to AMT; however, this would not prevent the fund from investing in such securities as a temporary defensive measure discussed below.<br /><br />The fund may purchase certain variable rate demand securities issued by single state or national closed-end municipal bond funds, which, in turn, invest primarily in portfolios of tax-exempt municipal bonds. It is anticipated that the interest on the variable rate demand securities will be exempt from federal income tax,  including the AMT. These securities are considered &#8220;municipal money market securities&#8221; for purposes of the fund&#8217;s 80% investment policy stated above.<br /><br />Many of the fund&#8217;s securities will be subject to credit or liquidity enhancements from U.S. and/or non-U.S. entities, which are designed to provide incremental levels of creditworthiness or liquidity. Some municipal securities have been structured to resemble variable- and floating-rate securities so that they meet the requirements for being considered money market instruments. <br /><br />In choosing securities, the fund&#8217;s manager seeks to maximize current income within the limits of the fund&#8217;s investment objective and credit, maturity and diversification policies.<br /><br /> Some of these policies may be stricter than the federal regulations that apply to all money funds.<br /><br />The investment adviser&#8217;s credit research department analyzes and monitors the securities that the fund owns or is considering buying. The manager may adjust the fund&#8217;s holdings or its average maturity based on actual or anticipated changes in interest rates or credit quality. To preserve its investors&#8217; capital, the fund seeks to maintain a stable $1.00 share price.<br /><br />During unusual market conditions, the fund may invest in taxable money market securities and municipal securities whose interest is subject to the AMT as a temporary defensive measure. When the fund engages in such activities, it may not achieve its investment goal."
Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004500_MemberSchwabAmtTaxFreeMoneyFund_Member,,,,,"The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund&#8217;s principal risks include:<br /><br /><b>Investment Risk.</b> Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.<br /><br /><b>Interest Rate Risk.</b> Interest rates rise and fall over time. As with any investment whose yield reflects current interest rates, the fund&#8217;s yield will change over time. During periods when interest rates are low, the fund&#8217;s yield (and total return) also will be low. In addition, to the extent the Value Advantage Shares make any reimbursement payments to the investment adviser and/or its affiliates, the Value Advantage Shares&#8217;s yield would be lower.<br /><br /><b>Credit Risk.</b> The fund is subject to the risk that a decline in the credit quality of a portfolio investment could cause the fund to lose money or underperform. The fund could lose money if the issuer of a portfolio investment fails to make timely principal or interest payments or if a guarantor or liquidity provider of a portfolio investment fails to honor its obligations. For fixed rate investments, negative perceptions of the ability of an issuer, guarantor or liquidity provider to make payments or otherwise honor its obligations, as applicable, could also cause the price of that investment to decline. The credit quality of the fund&#8217;s portfolio holdings can change rapidly in certain market environments and any downgrade or default on the part of a single portfolio investment could cause the fund&#8217;s share price or yield to fall. The fund&#8217;s investments in securities with credit or liquidity enhancements provided by foreign entities may involve certain risks that are greater than those associated with investments in securities with credit or liquidity enhancements provided by U.S. entities. These include risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions; differing accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards and practices; differing securities market structures; and higher transaction costs. In addition, sovereign risk, or the risk that a government may become unwilling or unable to meet its loan obligations or guarantees, could increase the credit risk of financial institutions connected to that particular country.<br /><br /><b>Liquidity Support Provider Risk.</b> The fund may invest a substantial portion of its assets in securities with guarantees and/or liquidity supports provided by a bank or other financial institution, and the existence and nature of such supports may be a significant factor in the investment adviser&#8217;s decision-making process. Generally, these enhancements are employed by the issuers of the securities to reduce credit risk and provide enhanced or back-up liquidity for the purchaser, such as the fund. Adverse developments affecting these banks and financial institutions could therefore have a negative effect on the value of the fund&#8217;s holdings. For example, a rating agency downgrade of a credit or liquidity support provider may adversely affect the value of securities held by the fund. Any decline in the value of the securities held by the fund could cause the fund&#8217;s share price or yield to fall. To the extent that a portion of the fund&#8217;s underlying investments are guaranteed by the same bank or financial institution, these risks may be increased.<br /><br /> <b>Management Risk.</b> Any actively managed mutual fund is subject to the risk that its investment adviser will make poor security selections. The fund&#8217;s investment adviser applies its own investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the fund, but there can be no guarantee that they will produce the desired results. The investment adviser&#8217;s maturity decisions will also affect the fund&#8217;s yield, and in unusual circumstances potentially could affect its share price. To the extent that the investment adviser anticipates interest rate trends imprecisely, the fund&#8217;s yield at times could lag those of other money market funds.<br /><br /><b>State and Regional Risk.</b> State and regional factors could affect the fund&#8217;s performance. To the extent that the fund invests in securities from a given state or geographic region, its share price and performance could be affected by local, state and regional factors, including erosion of the tax base and changes in the economic climate. National governmental actions, such as the elimination of tax-exempt status, also could affect performance. In addition, a municipality or municipal project that relies directly or indirectly on national governmental funding mechanisms may be negatively affected by the national government&#8217;s current budgetary constraints.<br /><br /><b>Investment Concentration Risk.</b> To the extent that the fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in municipal securities financing similar projects, the fund may be more sensitive to adverse economic, business or political developments. A change that affects one project, such as proposed legislation on the financing of the project, a shortage of materials needed for the project, or a declining need for the project, would likely affect all similar projects and the overall municipal securities market.<br /><br /><b>Taxable Determinations Risk.</b> Some of the fund&#8217;s income could be taxable. If certain types of investments the fund buys as tax-exempt are later ruled to be taxable, a portion of the fund&#8217;s income could become taxable. This risk, although generally considered low, is somewhat higher for investments that have been structured as municipal money market securities than for investments in other types of municipal money market securities. Any defensive investments in taxable securities or securities whose interest is subject to the AMT could generate taxable income.<br /><br /><b>Liquidity Risk.</b> Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell. The market for certain investments may become illiquid due to specific adverse changes in the conditions of a particular issuer or under adverse market or economic conditions independent of the issuer. The fund&#8217;s investments in illiquid securities may reduce the returns of the fund because it may be unable to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. Further, transactions in illiquid securities may entail transaction costs that are higher than those for transactions in liquid securities.<br /><br /> <b>Redemption Risk.</b> The fund may experience periods of heavy redemptions that could cause the fund to liquidate its assets at inopportune times or at a loss or depressed value, particularly during periods of declining or illiquid markets. Redemptions by a few large investors in the fund may have a significant adverse effect on the fund&#8217;s ability to maintain a stable $1.00 share price. In the event any money market fund fails to maintain a stable net asset value, other money market funds, including the fund, could face a market-wide risk of increased redemption pressures, potentially jeopardizing the stability of their $1.00 share prices.<br /><br /><b>Regulatory Risk.</b> The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulators may adopt additional money market fund regulations in the future, which may impact the operation and performance of the fund.<br /><br /><b>Money Market Risk.</b> The fund is not designed to offer capital appreciation. In exchange for their emphasis on stability and liquidity, money market investments may offer lower long-term performance than stock or bond investments."

The example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Investor Shares&#8217; operating expenses remain the same. The figures are based on total annual fund operating expenses after expense reduction. The expenses would be the same whether you stayed in the fund or sold your shares at the end of each period. Your actual costs may be higher or lower."

Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000019114_Member,,,,,"The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund&#8217;s principal risks include:<br/><br/><b>Investment Risk.</b> Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.<br/><br/><b>Interest Rate Risk.</b> Interest rates rise and fall over time. As with any investment whose yield reflects current interest rates, the fund&#8217;s yield will change over time. During periods when interest rates are low, the fund&#8217;s yield (and total return) also will be low. In addition, to the extent the Value Advantage Shares make any reimbursement payments to the investment adviser and/or its affiliates, the Value Advantage Shares&#8217;s yield would be lower.<br/><br/><b>Credit Risk.</b> The fund is subject to the risk that a decline in the credit quality of a portfolio investment could cause the fund to lose money or underperform. The fund could lose money if the issuer of a portfolio investment fails to make timely principal or interest payments or if a guarantor or liquidity provider of a portfolio investment fails to honor its obligations. For fixed rate investments, negative perceptions of the ability of an issuer, guarantor or liquidity provider to make payments or otherwise honor its obligations, as applicable, could also cause the price of that investment to decline. The credit quality of the fund&#8217;s portfolio holdings can change rapidly in certain market environments and any downgrade or default on the part of a single portfolio investment could cause the fund&#8217;s share price or yield to fall. The fund&#8217;s investments in securities with credit or liquidity enhancements provided by foreign entities may involve certain risks that are greater than those associated with investments in securities with credit or liquidity enhancements provided by U.S. entities. These include risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions; differing accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards and practices; differing securities market structures; and higher transaction costs. In addition, sovereign risk, or the risk that a government may become unwilling or unable to meet its loan obligations or guarantees, could increase the credit risk of financial institutions connected to that particular country.<br/><br/><b>Liquidity Support Provider</b> Risk. The fund may invest a substantial portion of its assets in securities with guarantees and/or liquidity supports provided by a bank or other financial institution, and the existence and nature of such supports may be a significant factor in the investment adviser&#8217;s decision-making process. Generally, these enhancements are employed by the issuers of the securities to reduce credit risk and provide enhanced or back-up liquidity for the purchaser, such as the fund. Adverse developments affecting these banks and financial institutions could therefore have a negative effect on the value of the fund&#8217;s holdings. For example, a rating agency downgrade of a credit or liquidity support provider may adversely affect the value of securities held by the fund. Any decline in the value of the securities held by the fund could cause the fund&#8217;s share price or yield to fall. To the extent that a portion of the fund&#8217;s underlying investments are guaranteed by the same bank or financial institution, these risks may be increased.<br/><br/><b>Management Risk.</b> Any actively managed mutual fund is subject to the risk that its investment adviser will make poor security selections. The fund&#8217;s investment adviser applies its own investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the fund, but there can be no guarantee that they will produce the desired results. The investment adviser&#8217;s maturity decisions will also affect the fund&#8217;s yield, and in unusual circumstances potentially could affect its share price. To the extent that the investment adviser anticipates interest rate trends imprecisely, the fund&#8217;s yield at times could lag those of other money market funds.<br/><br/><b>State Risk.</b> The fund invests primarily in securities issued by the state of California and its municipalities. Any reduction in the credit ratings of obligations of these issuers could adversely affect the market values and marketability of such securities, and, consequently, the value of the fund&#8217;s portfolio. Further, the fund&#8217;s share price and performance could be affected by local, state and regional factors, including erosion of the tax base and changes in the economic climate. Certain California constitutional amendments, legislative measures, executive orders, administrative regulations and voter initiatives could result in adverse consequences affecting the state of California and/or its  municipalities. The possibility exists that a natural disaster, including an earthquake, could create a major dislocation of the California economy and significantly affect the ability of state and local governments to raise money to pay principal and interest on their municipal securities. National governmental actions, such as the elimination of tax-exempt status, also could affect performance. In addition, a municipality or municipal project that relies directly or indirectly on national governmental funding mechanisms may be negatively affected by the national government&#8217;s current budgetary constraints.<br/><br/><b>Investment Concentration Risk.</b> To the extent that the fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in municipal securities financing similar projects, the fund may be more sensitive to adverse economic, business or political developments. A change that affects one project, such as proposed legislation on the financing of the project, a shortage of materials needed for the project, or a declining need for the project, would likely affect all similar projects and the overall municipal securities market.<br/><br/><b>Taxable Determinations Risk.</b> Some of the fund&#8217;s income could be taxable. If certain types of investments the fund buys as tax-exempt are later ruled to be taxable, a portion of the fund&#8217;s income could become taxable. This risk, although generally considered low, is somewhat higher for investments that have been structured as municipal money market securities than for investments in other types of municipal money market securities. Any defensive investments in taxable securities or securities whose interest is subject to the AMT could generate taxable income.<br/><br/><b>Liquidity Risk.</b> Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell. The market for certain investments may become illiquid due to specific adverse changes in the conditions of a particular issuer or under adverse market or economic conditions independent of the issuer. The fund&#8217;s investments in illiquid securities may reduce the returns of the fund because it may be unable to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. Further, transactions in illiquid securities may entail transaction costs that are higher than those for transactions in liquid securities.<br/><br/><b>Redemption Risk.</b> The fund may experience periods of heavy redemptions that could cause the fund to liquidate its assets at inopportune times or at a loss or depressed value, particularly during periods of declining or illiquid markets. Redemptions by a few large investors in the fund may have a significant adverse effect on the fund&#8217;s ability to maintain a stable $1.00 share price. In the event any money market fund fails to maintain a stable net asset value, other money market funds, including the fund, could face a market-wide risk of increased redemption pressures, potentially jeopardizing the stability of their $1.00 share prices.<br/><br/><b>Regulatory Risk.</b> The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulators may adopt additional money market fund regulations in the future, which may impact the operation and performance of the fund.<br/><br/><b>Money Market Risk.</b> The fund is not designed to offer capital appreciation. In exchange for their emphasis on stability and liquidity, money market investments may offer lower long-term performance than stock or bond investments."

In addition, to the extent the Investor Shares make any reimbursement payments to the investment adviser and/or its affiliates, the Investor Shares&#8217;s yield would be lower.<br/><br/><b>Repurchase Agreements Risk.</b> When the fund enters into a repurchase agreement, the fund is exposed to the risk that the other party (i.e., the counter-party) will not fulfill its contractual obligation. In a repurchase agreement, there exists the risk that, when the fund buys a security from a counter-party that agrees to repurchase the security at an agreed upon price (usually higher) and time, the counter-party will not repurchase the security. These risks are magnified to the extent that a repurchase agreement is secured by collateral other than cash and government securities, such as debt securities, equity securities and high yield securities that are rated below investment grade (&#8220;Alternative Collateral&#8221;). High yield securities that are used as Alternative Collateral are subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risk, and are considered primarily speculative with respect to the issuer&#8217;s continuing ability to make principal and interest payments. Alternative Collateral may be subject to greater price volatility and may be more volatile or less liquid than other types of collateral, increasing the risk that the fund will be unable to recover fully in the event of a counterparty&#8217;s default.<br/><br/><b>Credit Risk. </b> The fund is subject to the risk that a decline in the credit quality of a portfolio investment could cause the fund to lose money or underperform. The fund could lose money if the issuer of a portfolio investment fails to make timely principal or interest payments or if a guarantor, liquidity provider or counterparty of a portfolio investment fails to honor its obligations. Even though the fund&#8217;s investments in repurchase agreements are collateralized at all times, there is some risk to the fund if the other party should default on its obligations and the fund is delayed or prevented from recovering or disposing of the collateral. Negative perceptions of the ability of an issuer, guarantor, liquidity provider or counterparty to make payments or otherwise honor its obligations, as applicable, could also cause the price of that investment to decline. The credit quality of the fund&#8217;s portfolio holdings can change rapidly in certain market environments and any downgrade or default on the part of a single portfolio investment could cause the fund&#8217;s share price or yield to fall.<br/><br/>Many of the U.S. government securities that the fund invests in are not backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government, which means they are neither issued nor guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury. Although maintained in conservatorship by the Federal Housing Finance Agency since September 2008, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) maintain only limited lines of credit with the U.S. Treasury. The Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB) also only maintain limited access to credit lines from the U.S. Treasury. Other securities, such as obligations issued by the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation (FFCB), are supported solely by the credit of the issuer. There can be no assurance that the U.S. government will provide financial support to securities of its agencies and instrumentalities if it is not obligated to do so under law. Also, any government guarantees on securities the fund owns do not extend to shares of the fund itself.<br/><br/><b>Foreign Investment Risk. </b> The fund&#8217;s investments in securities of foreign issuers or securities with credit or liquidity enhancements provided by foreign entities may involve certain risks that are greater than those associated with investments in securities of U.S. issuers or securities with credit or liquidity enhancements provided by U.S. entities. These include risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions; differing accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards and practices; differing securities market structures; and higher transaction costs.

Strategy Narrative [Text Block],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004512_MemberSchwabCaliforniaMunicipalMoneyFundValueAdvantageShares_Member,,,,,"<b>To pursue its goal, the fund invests in money market securities from California issuers and from municipal agencies, U.S. territories and possessions. </b>These securities may include general obligation issues, which typically are backed by the issuer&#8217;s ability to levy taxes; revenue bonds, which typically are backed by a stream of revenue from a given source, such as a public water system or hospital; municipal commercial paper and municipal notes; and municipal leases, which may be used to finance construction or equipment purchases. The fund may invest more than 25% of its total assets in municipal securities financing similar projects such as those relating to education, health care, transportation, utilities, industrial development and housing. Under normal circumstances, the fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets in municipal money market securities the interest from which is exempt from federal and California personal income tax.  <br/><br/>The fund may purchase certain variable rate demand securities issued by closed-end municipal bond funds, which, in turn, invest primarily in portfolios of California tax-exempt municipal bonds. It is anticipated that the interest on the variable rate demand securities will be exempt from federal income tax and California personal income tax. These securities are considered &#8220;municipal money market securities&#8221; for purposes of the fund&#8217;s 80% investment policy stated above. <br/><br/>Many of the fund&#8217;s securities will be subject to credit or liquidity enhancements from U.S. and/or non-U.S. entities, which are designed to provide incremental levels of creditworthiness or liquidity. Some municipal securities have been structured to resemble variable- and floating-rate securities so that they meet the requirements for being considered money market instruments.  <br/><br/>In choosing securities, the fund&#8217;s manager seeks to maximize current income within the limits of the fund&#8217;s investment objective and credit, maturity and diversification policies. Some of these policies may be stricter than the federal regulations that apply to all money funds.  <br/><br/>The investment adviser&#8217;s credit research department analyzes and monitors the securities that the fund owns or is considering buying. The manager may adjust the fund&#8217;s holdings or its average maturity based on actual or anticipated changes in interest rates or credit quality. To preserve its investors&#8217; capital, the fund seeks to maintain a stable $1.00 share price.  <br/><br/>During unusual market conditions, the fund may invest in taxable money market securities as a temporary defensive measure. When the fund engages in such activities, it may not achieve its investment goal."
Risk [Heading],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004512_MemberSchwabCaliforniaMunicipalMoneyFundValueAdvantageShares_Member,,,,,<b>Principal risks </b>
Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004512_MemberSchwabCaliforniaMunicipalMoneyFundValueAdvantageShares_Member,,,,,"The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund&#8217;s principal risks include:<br/><br/><b>Investment Risk.</b> Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.<br/><br/><b>Interest Rate Risk.</b> Interest rates rise and fall over time. As with any investment whose yield reflects current interest rates, the fund&#8217;s yield will change over time. During periods when interest rates are low, the fund&#8217;s yield (and total return) also will be low. In addition, to the extent the Value Advantage Shares make any reimbursement payments to the investment adviser and/or its affiliates, the Value Advantage Shares&#8217;s yield would be lower.<br/><br/><b>Credit Risk.</b> The fund is subject to the risk that a decline in the credit quality of a portfolio investment could cause the fund to lose money or underperform. The fund could lose money if the issuer of a portfolio investment fails to make timely principal or interest payments or if a guarantor or liquidity provider of a portfolio investment fails to honor its obligations. For fixed rate investments, negative perceptions of the ability of an issuer, guarantor or liquidity provider to make payments or otherwise honor its obligations, as applicable, could also cause the price of that investment to decline. The credit quality of the fund&#8217;s portfolio holdings can change rapidly in certain market environments and any downgrade or default on the part of a single portfolio investment could cause the fund&#8217;s share price or yield to fall. The fund&#8217;s investments in securities with credit or liquidity enhancements provided by foreign entities may involve certain risks that are greater than those associated with investments in securities with credit or liquidity enhancements provided by U.S. entities. These include risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions; differing accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards and practices; differing securities market structures; and higher transaction costs. In addition, sovereign risk, or the risk that a government may become unwilling or unable to meet its loan obligations or guarantees, could increase the credit risk of financial institutions connected to that particular country.<br/><br/><b>Liquidity Support Provider Risk. </b>The fund may invest a substantial portion of its assets in securities with guarantees and/or liquidity supports provided by a bank or other financial institution, and the existence and nature of such supports may be a significant factor in the investment adviser&#8217;s decision-making process. Generally, these enhancements are employed by the issuers of the securities to reduce credit risk and provide enhanced or back-up liquidity for the purchaser, such as the fund. Adverse developments affecting these banks and financial institutions could therefore have a negative effect on the value of the fund&#8217;s holdings. For example, a rating agency downgrade of a credit or liquidity support provider may adversely affect the value of securities held by the fund. Any decline in the value of the securities held by the fund could cause the fund&#8217;s share price or yield to fall. To the extent that a portion of the fund&#8217;s underlying investments are guaranteed by the same bank or financial institution, these risks may be increased.<br/><br/><b>Management Risk.</b> Any actively managed mutual fund is subject to the risk that its investment adviser will make poor security selections. The fund&#8217;s investment adviser applies its own investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the fund, but there can be no guarantee that they will produce the desired results. The investment adviser&#8217;s maturity decisions will also affect the fund&#8217;s yield, and in unusual circumstances potentially could affect its share price. To the extent that the investment adviser anticipates interest rate trends imprecisely, the fund&#8217;s yield at times could lag those of other money market funds.<br/><br/><b>State Risk.</b> The fund invests primarily in securities issued by the state of California and its municipalities. Any reduction in the credit ratings of obligations of these issuers could adversely affect the market values and marketability of such securities, and, consequently, the value of the fund&#8217;s portfolio. Further, the fund&#8217;s share price and performance could be affected by local, state and regional factors, including erosion of the tax base and changes in the economic climate. Certain California constitutional amendments, legislative measures, executive orders, administrative regulations and voter initiatives could result in adverse consequences affecting the state of California and/or its municipalities. The possibility exists that a natural disaster, including an earthquake, could create a major dislocation of the California economy and significantly affect the ability of state and local governments to raise money to pay principal and interest on their municipal securities. National governmental actions, such as  the elimination of tax-exempt status, also could affect performance. In addition, a municipality or municipal project that relies directly or indirectly on national governmental funding mechanisms may be negatively affected by the national government&#8217;s current budgetary constraints.<br/><br/><b>Investment Concentration Risk.</b> To the extent that the fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in municipal securities financing similar projects, the fund may be more sensitive to adverse economic, business or political developments. A change that affects one project, such as proposed legislation on the financing of the project, a shortage of materials needed for the project, or a declining need for the project, would likely affect all similar projects and the overall municipal securities market.<br/><br/><b>Taxable Determinations Risk.</b> Some of the fund&#8217;s income could be taxable. If certain types of investments the fund buys as tax-exempt are later ruled to be taxable, a portion of the fund&#8217;s income could become taxable. This risk, although generally considered low, is somewhat higher for investments that have been structured as municipal money market securities than for investments in other types of municipal money market securities. Any defensive investments in taxable securities could generate taxable income. Also, some types of municipal securities produce income that is subject to the federal alternative minimum tax (AMT).<br/><br/><b>Liquidity Risk.</b> Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell. The market for certain investments may become illiquid due to specific adverse changes in the conditions of a particular issuer or under adverse market or economic conditions independent of the issuer. The fund&#8217;s investments in illiquid securities may reduce the returns of the fund because it may be unable to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. Further, transactions in illiquid securities may entail transaction costs that are higher than those for transactions in liquid securities.<br/><br/><b>Redemption Risk.</b> The fund may experience periods of heavy redemptions that could cause the fund to liquidate its assets at inopportune times or at a loss or depressed value, particularly during periods of declining or illiquid markets. Redemptions by a few large investors in the fund may have a significant adverse effect on the fund&#8217;s ability to maintain a stable $1.00 share price. In the event any money market fund fails to maintain a stable net asset value, other money market funds, including the fund, could face a market-wide risk of increased redemption pressures, potentially jeopardizing the stability of their $1.00 share prices.<br/><br/><b>Regulatory Risk.</b> The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulators may adopt additional money market fund regulations in the future, which may impact the operation and performance of the fund.<br/><br/><b>Money Market Risk.</b> The fund is not designed to offer capital appreciation. In exchange for their emphasis on stability and liquidity, money market investments may offer lower long-term performance than stock or bond investments."

Strategy Narrative [Text Block],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000036659_MemberSchwabTreasuryObligationsMoneyFundValueAdvantageShares_Member,,,,,"<b>To pursue its goal, the fund typically invests in securities backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government and repurchase agreements backed by such investments. </b>Under normal circumstances, the fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets in U.S. Treasury obligations and repurchase agreements backed by such obligations. The fund will notify its shareholders at least 60 days before changing this policy. The full faith and credit backing is the strongest backing offered by the U.S. government, and traditionally is considered by investors to be the highest degree of safety as far as the payment of principal and interest.<br/><br/>Based on the fund manager&#8217;s view of market conditions for U.S. Treasury securities, the fund may invest up to 20% of its net assets in: (i) obligations that are issued by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities, including obligations that are not guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury, such as those issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks, and repurchase agreements backed by such obligations; and (ii) obligations that are issued by private issuers that are guaranteed as to principal or interest by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities. Obligations that are issued by private issuers that are guaranteed as to principal or interest by the U.S. government,  its agencies or instrumentalities are considered U.S. government securities under the rules that govern money market funds.<br/><br/>In choosing securities, the fund&#8217;s manager seeks to maximize current income within the limits of the fund&#8217;s investment objective and credit, maturity and diversification policies. By investing primarily in full faith and credit U.S. government investments and repurchase agreements backed by such investments, the fund seeks to provide safety as to its assets. The portfolio manager may adjust the fund&#8217;s average maturity based on current and anticipated changes in interest rates. To preserve its investors&#8217; capital, the fund seeks to maintain a stable $1 share price.<br/><br/>For temporary defensive purposes during unusual market conditions, the fund may invest up to 100% of its assets in cash, cash equivalents or other high quality short-term investments."
Risk [Heading],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000036659_MemberSchwabTreasuryObligationsMoneyFundValueAdvantageShares_Member,,,,,<b>Principal risks </b>
Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000036659_MemberSchwabTreasuryObligationsMoneyFundValueAdvantageShares_Member,,,,,"The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund&#8217;s principal risks include:<br/><br/><b>Investment Risk. </b> Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.<br/><br/><b>Interest Rate Risk. </b> Interest rates rise and fall over time. As with any investment whose yield reflects current interest rates, the fund&#8217;s yield will change over time. During periods when interest rates are low, the fund&#8217;s yield (and total return) also will be low. In addition, to the extent the fund makes any reimbursement payments to the investment adviser and/or its affiliates, the fund&#8217;s yield would be lower.<br/><br/><b>Credit Risk. </b> The fund is subject to the risk that a decline in the credit quality of a portfolio investment could cause the fund to lose money or underperform. The fund could lose money if the issuer or guarantor of a portfolio investment fails to make timely principal or interest payments or otherwise honor its obligations. Even though the fund&#8217;s investments in repurchase agreements are collateralized at all times, there is some risk to the fund if the other party should default on its obligations and the fund is delayed or prevented from recovering or disposing of the collateral. Negative perceptions of the ability of an issuer or guarantor to make payments or otherwise honor its obligations could also cause the price of that investment to downgrade or decline. The credit quality of the fund&#8217;s portfolio holdings can change rapidly in certain market environments and any default on the part of a single portfolio investment could cause the fund&#8217;s share price or yield to fall. Certain U.S. government securities that the fund may invest in are not backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government, which means they are neither issued nor guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury. Although maintained in conservatorship by the Federal Housing Finance Agency since September 2008, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) maintain only limited lines of credit with the U.S. Treasury. The Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB) also only maintain limited access to credit lines from the U.S. Treasury. Other securities, such as obligations issued by the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation (FFCB), are supported solely by the credit of the issuer. There can be no assurance that the U.S. government will provide financial support to securities of its agencies and instrumentalities if it is not obligated to do so under law. Also, any government guarantees on securities the fund owns do not extend to shares of the fund itself.<br/><br/><b>Repurchase Agreements Risk. </b> When the fund enters into a repurchase agreement, the fund is exposed to the risk that the other party (i.e., the counter-party) will not fulfill its contractual obligation. In a repurchase agreement, there exists the risk that when the fund buys a security from a counter-party that agrees to repurchase the security at an agreed upon price (usually higher) and time, the counter-party will not repurchase the security.<br/><br/><b>Management Risk. </b> Any actively managed mutual fund is subject to the risk that its investment adviser will make poor security selections. The fund&#8217;s investment adviser applies its own investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the fund, but there can be no guarantee that they will produce the desired results. The investment adviser&#8217;s maturity decisions will also affect the fund&#8217;s yield, and in unusual circumstances potentially could affect its share price. To the extent that the investment adviser anticipates interest rate trends imprecisely, the fund&#8217;s yield at times could lag those of other money market funds.<br/><br/><b>Liquidity Risk. </b> Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell. The market for certain investments may become illiquid due to specific adverse changes in the conditions of a particular issuer or under adverse market or economic conditions independent of the issuer. The fund&#8217;s investments in illiquid securities may reduce the returns of the fund because it may be unable to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. Further, transactions in illiquid securities may entail transaction costs that are higher than those for transactions in liquid securities.<br/><br/><b>Redemption Risk. </b> The fund may experience periods of heavy redemptions that could cause the fund to liquidate its assets at inopportune times or at a loss or depressed value, particularly during periods of declining or illiquid markets. Redemptions by a few large investors in the fund may have a significant adverse effect on the fund&#8217;s ability to maintain a stable $1.00 share price. In the event any money market fund fails to maintain a stable net asset value, other money market funds, including the fund, could face a market-wide risk of increased redemption pressures, potentially jeopardizing the stability of their $1.00 share prices.<br/><br/><b>Regulatory Risk. </b> The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulators may adopt additional money market fund regulations in the future, which may impact the operation and performance of the fund.<br/><br/><b>Money Market Risk. </b> The fund is not designed to offer capital appreciation. In exchange for their emphasis on stability and liquidity, money market investments may offer lower long-term performance than stock or bond investments."

Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004505_Member,,,,,"The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund&#8217;s principal risks include:<br/><br/><b>Investment Risk.</b> Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.<br/><br/><b>Interest Rate Risk.</b> Interest rates rise and fall over time. As with any investment whose yield reflects current interest rates, the fund&#8217;s yield will change over time. During periods when interest rates are low, the fund&#8217;s yield (and total return) also will be low. In addition, to the extent a share class makes any reimbursement payments to the investment adviser and/or its affiliates, the share class&#8217;s yield would be lower.<br/><br/><b>Repurchase Agreements Risk.</b> When the fund enters into a repurchase agreement, the fund is exposed to the risk that the other party (i.e., the counter-party) will not fulfill its contractual obligation. In a repurchase agreement, there exists the risk that, when the fund buys a security from a counter-party that agrees to repurchase the security at an agreed upon price (usually higher) and time, the counter-party will not repurchase the security. These risks are magnified to the extent that a repurchase agreement is secured by collateral other than cash and government securities, such as debt securities, equity securities and high yield securities that are rated below investment grade (&#8220;Alternative Collateral&#8221;). High yield securities that are used as Alternative Collateral are subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risk, and are considered primarily speculative with respect to the issuer&#8217;s continuing ability to make principal and interest payments. Alternative Collateral may be subject to greater price volatility and may be more volatile or less liquid than other types of collateral, increasing the risk that the fund will be unable to recover fully in the event of a counterparty&#8217;s default.<br/><br/><b>Credit Risk.</b> The fund is subject to the risk that a decline in the credit quality of a portfolio investment could cause the fund to lose money or underperform. The fund could lose money if the issuer of a portfolio investment fails to make timely principal or interest payments or if a guarantor, liquidity provider or counterparty of a portfolio investment fails to honor its obligations. Even though the fund&#8217;s investments in repurchase agreements are collateralized at all times, there is some risk to the fund if the other party should default on its obligations and the fund is delayed or prevented from recovering or disposing of the collateral. Negative perceptions of the ability of an issuer, guarantor, liquidity provider or counterparty to make payments or otherwise honor its obligations, as applicable, could also cause the price of that investment to decline. The credit quality of the fund&#8217;s portfolio holdings can change rapidly in certain market environments and any downgrade or default on the part of a single portfolio investment could cause the fund&#8217;s share price or yield to fall.<br/><br/>Many of the U.S. government securities that the fund invests in are not backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government, which means they are neither issued nor guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury. Although maintained in conservatorship by the Federal Housing Finance Agency since September 2008, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) maintain only limited lines of credit with the U.S. Treasury. The Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB) also only maintain limited access to credit lines from the U.S. Treasury. Other securities, such as obligations issued by the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation (FFCB), are supported solely by the credit of the issuer. There can be no assurance that the U.S. government will provide financial support to securities of its agencies and instrumentalities if it is not obligated to do so under law. Also, any government guarantees on securities the fund owns do not extend to the shares of the fund itself.<br/><br/><b>Foreign Investment Risk.</b> The fund&#8217;s investments in securities of foreign issuers or securities with credit or liquidity enhancements provided by foreign entities may involve certain risks that are greater than those associated with investments in securities of U.S. issuers or securities with credit or liquidity enhancements provided by U.S. entities. These include risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions; differing accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards and practices; differing securities market structures; and higher transaction costs. In addition, sovereign risk, or the risk that a government may become unwilling or unable to meet its loan obligations or guarantees, could increase the credit risk of financial institutions connected to that particular country.<br/><br/><b>Management Risk.</b> Any actively managed mutual fund is subject to the risk that its investment adviser will make poor security selections. The fund&#8217;s investment adviser applies its own investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the fund, but there can be no guarantee that they will produce the desired results. The investment adviser&#8217;s maturity decisions will also affect the fund&#8217;s yield, and in unusual circumstances potentially could affect its share price. To the extent that the investment adviser anticipates interest rate trends imprecisely, the fund&#8217;s yield at times could lag those of other money market funds.<br/><br/><b>Liquidity Risk.</b> Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell. The market for certain investments may become illiquid due to specific adverse changes in the conditions of a particular issuer or under adverse market or economic conditions independent of the issuer. The fund&#8217;s investments in illiquid securities may reduce the returns of the fund because it may be unable to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. Further, transactions in illiquid securities may entail transaction costs that are higher than those for transactions in liquid securities.<br/><br/><b>Redemption Risk.</b> The fund may experience periods of heavy redemptions that could cause the fund to liquidate its assets at inopportune times or at a loss or depressed value, particularly during periods of declining or illiquid markets. Redemptions by a few large investors in the fund may have a significant adverse effect on the fund&#8217;s ability to maintain a stable $1.00 share price. In the event any money market fund fails to maintain a stable net asset value, other money market funds, including the fund, could face a market-wide risk of increased redemption pressures, potentially jeopardizing the stability of their $1.00 share prices.<br/><br/><b>Regulatory Risk.</b> The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulators may adopt additional money market fund regulations in the future, which may impact the operation and performance of the fund.<br/><br/><b>Money Market Risk.</b> The fund is not designed to offer capital appreciation. In exchange for their emphasis on stability and liquidity, money market investments may offer lower long-term performance than stock or bond investments."

Risk/Return [Heading],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004507_Member,,,,,Schwab U.S. Treasury Money Fund<sup>&#8482;</sup>
Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004506_Member,,,,,"The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund&#8217;s principal risks include:<br /><br /><b>Investment Risk.</b> Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.<br /><br /><b>Interest Rate Risk.</b> Interest rates rise and fall over time. As with any investment whose yield reflects current interest rates, the fund&#8217;s yield will change over time. During periods when interest rates are low, the fund&#8217;s yield (and total return) also will be low. In addition, to the extent the fund makes any reimbursement payments to the investment adviser and/or its affiliates, the fund&#8217;s yield would be lower.<br /><br /><b>Repurchase Agreements Risk.</b> When the fund enters into a repurchase agreement, the fund is exposed to the risk that the other party (i.e., the counter-party) will not fulfill its contractual obligation. In a repurchase agreement, there exists the risk that, when the fund buys a security from a counter-party that agrees to repurchase the security at an agreed upon price (usually higher) and time, the counter-party will not repurchase the security.<br /><br /><b>Credit Risk.</b> The fund is subject to the risk that a decline in the credit quality of a portfolio investment could cause the fund to lose money or underperform. The fund could lose money if the issuer of a portfolio investment fails to make timely principal or interest payments or if a guarantor, liquidity provider or counterparty of a portfolio investment fails to honor its obligations. Even though the fund&#8217;s investments in repurchase agreements are collateralized at all times, there is some risk to the fund if the other party should default on its obligations and the fund is delayed or prevented from recovering or disposing of the collateral. Negative perceptions of the ability of an issuer, guarantor, liquidity provider or counterparty to make payments or otherwise honor its obligations, as applicable, could also cause the price of that investment to decline. The credit quality of the fund&#8217;s portfolio holdings can change rapidly in certain market environments and any downgrade or default on the part of a single portfolio investment could cause the fund&#8217;s share price or yield to fall.  <br /><br />Many of the U.S. government securities that the fund invests in are not backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government, which means they are neither issued nor guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury. Although maintained in conservatorship by the Federal Housing Finance Agency since September 2008, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) maintain only limited lines of credit with the U.S. Treasury. The Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB) also only maintain limited access to credit lines from the U.S. Treasury. Other securities, such as obligations issued by the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation (FFCB), are supported solely by the credit of the issuer. There can be no assurance that the U.S. government will provide financial support to securities of its agencies and instrumentalities if it is not obligated to do so under law. Also, any government guarantees on securities the fund owns do not extend to shares of the fund itself.<br /><br /><b>Management Risk.</b> Any actively managed mutual fund is subject to the risk that its investment adviser will make poor security selections. The fund&#8217;s investment adviser applies its own investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the fund, but there can be no guarantee that they will produce the desired results. The investment adviser&#8217;s maturity decisions will also affect the fund&#8217;s yield, and in unusual circumstances potentially could affect its share price. To the extent that the investment adviser anticipates interest rate trends imprecisely, the fund&#8217;s yield at times could lag those of other money market funds.<br /><br /><b>Liquidity Risk.</b> Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell. The market for certain investments may become illiquid due to specific adverse changes in the conditions of a particular issuer or under adverse market or economic conditions independent of the issuer. The fund&#8217;s investments in illiquid securities may reduce the returns of the fund because it may be unable to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. Further, transactions in illiquid securities may entail transaction costs that are higher than those for transactions in liquid securities.<br /><br /><b>Redemption Risk.</b> The fund may experience periods of heavy redemptions that could cause the fund to liquidate its assets at inopportune times or at a loss or depressed value, particularly during periods of declining or illiquid markets. Redemptions by a few large investors in the fund may have a significant adverse effect on the fund&#8217;s ability to maintain a stable $1.00 share price. In the event any money market fund fails to maintain a stable net asset value, other money market funds, including the fund, could face a market-wide risk of increased redemption pressures, potentially jeopardizing the stability of their $1.00 share prices.<br /><br /><b>Regulatory Risk.</b> The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulators may adopt additional money market fund regulations in the future, which may impact the operation and performance of the fund.<br /><br /><b>Money Market Risk.</b> The fund is not designed to offer capital appreciation. In exchange for their emphasis on stability and liquidity, money market investments may offer lower long-term performance than stock or bond investments."

Strategy Narrative [Text Block],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004507_Member,,,,,"<b>To pursue its goal, the fund typically invests in securities backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.</b> Under normal circumstances, the fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets in U.S. Treasury securities; including bills and notes. The fund will notify its shareholders at least 60 days before changing this policy. The full faith and credit backing is the strongest backing offered by the U.S. government, and traditionally is considered by investors to be the highest degree of safety as far as the payment of principal and interest.<br/><br/>Based on the fund manager&#8217;s view of market conditions for U.S. Treasury securities, the fund may invest up to 20% of its net assets in: (i) obligations that are issued by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities, including obligations that are not guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury, such as those issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks; and (ii) obligations that are issued by private issuers that are guaranteed as to principal or interest by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities. Obligations that are issued by private issuers that are guaranteed as to principal or interest by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities are considered U.S. government securities under the rules that govern money market funds.<br/><br/>In choosing securities, the fund&#8217;s manager seeks to maximize current income within the limits of the fund&#8217;s investment objective and credit, maturity and diversification policies. By investing primarily in full faith and credit U.S. government investments, the fund seeks to provide maximum safety as to its assets. The fund is distinct from certain other types of government money funds in that it does not invest in repurchase agreements. The manager may adjust the fund&#8217;s average maturity based on current and anticipated changes in interest rates. To preserve its investors&#8217; capital, the fund seeks to maintain a stable $1 share price.<br/><br/>Because the income from U.S. Treasury securities is exempt from state and local income taxes, the fund generally expects that the majority of the dividends it pays will be exempt from those taxes as well. (Dividends still will be subject to federal income tax.) However, the fund may invest up to 20% of its net assets in non-U.S. Treasury investments that are not exempt from state and local income taxes. Further, during unusual market conditions, the fund may invest a greater portion of its assets in investments that are not exempt from state and local income taxes as a temporary defensive measure. When the fund engages in such activities, it may not achieve its investment goal."

Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004507_Member,,,,,"The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund&#8217;s principal risks include:<br/><br/><b>Investment Risk.</b> Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.<br/><br/><b>Interest Rate Risk.</b>  Interest rates rise and fall over time. As with any investment whose yield reflects current interest rates, the fund&#8217;s yield will change over time. During periods when interest rates are low, the fund&#8217;s yield (and total return) also will be low. In addition, to the extent the fund makes any reimbursement payments to the investment adviser and/or its affiliates, the fund&#8217;s yield would be lower.<br/><br/><b>Credit Risk.</b> The fund is subject to the risk that a decline in the credit quality of a portfolio investment could cause the fund to lose money or underperform. The fund could lose money if the issuer or guarantor of a portfolio investment fails to make timely principal or interest payments or otherwise honor its obligations. The negative perceptions of the ability of an issuer or guarantor to make payments or otherwise honor its obligations could also cause the price of that investment to downgrade or decline. The credit quality of the fund&#8217;s portfolio holdings can change rapidly in certain market environments and any default on the part of a single portfolio investment could cause the fund&#8217;s share price or yield to fall. Certain U.S. government securities that the fund may invest in are not backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government, which means they are neither issued nor guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury. Although maintained in conservatorship by the Federal Housing Finance Agency since September 2008, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) maintain only limited lines of credit with the U.S. Treasury. The Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB) also only maintain limited access to credit lines from the U.S. Treasury. Other securities, such as obligations issued by the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation (FFCB), are supported solely by the credit of the issuer. There can be no assurance that the U.S. government will provide financial support to securities of its agencies and instrumentalities if it is not obligated to do so under law. Also, any government guarantees on securities the fund owns do not extend to shares of the fund itself.<br/><br/><b>Management Risk.</b> Any actively managed mutual fund is subject to the risk that its investment adviser will make poor security selections. The fund&#8217;s investment adviser applies its own investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the fund, but there can be no guarantee that they will produce the desired results. The investment adviser&#8217;s maturity decisions will also affect the fund&#8217;s yield, and in unusual circumstances potentially could affect its share price. To the extent that the investment adviser anticipates interest rate trends imprecisely, the fund&#8217;s yield at times could lag those of other money market funds.<br/><br/><b>Liquidity Risk.</b> Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell. The market for certain investments may become illiquid due to specific adverse changes in the conditions of a particular issuer or under adverse market or economic conditions independent of the issuer. The fund&#8217;s investments in illiquid securities may reduce the returns of the fund because it may be unable to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. Further, transactions in illiquid securities may entail transaction costs that are higher than those for transactions in liquid securities.<br/><br/><b>Redemption Risk.</b> The fund may experience periods of heavy redemptions that could cause the fund to liquidate its assets at inopportune times or at a loss or depressed value, particularly during periods of declining or illiquid markets. Redemptions by a few large investors in the fund may have a significant adverse effect on the fund&#8217;s ability to maintain a stable $1.00 share price. In the event any money market fund fails to maintain a stable net asset value, other money market funds, including the fund, could face a market-wide risk of increased redemption pressures, potentially jeopardizing the stability of their $1.00 share prices.<br/><br/><b>Regulatory Risk.</b> The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulators may adopt additional money market fund regulations in the future, which may impact the operation and performance of the fund.<br/><br/><b>Money Market Risk.</b> The fund is not designed to offer capital appreciation. In exchange for their emphasis on stability and liquidity, money market investments may offer lower long-term performance than stock or bond investments."

Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.<br /><br /><b>Interest Rate Risk.</b> Interest rates rise and fall over time.

In addition, to the extent the fund makes any reimbursement payments to the investment adviser and/or its affiliates, the fund&#8217;s yield would be lower.<br /><br /><b>Repurchase Agreements Risk.</b> When the fund enters into a repurchase agreement, the fund is exposed to the risk that the other party (i.e., the counter-party) will not fulfill its contractual obligation. In a repurchase agreement, there exists the risk that, when the fund buys a security from a counter-party that agrees to repurchase the security at an agreed upon price (usually higher) and time, the counter-party will not repurchase the security. These risks are magnified to the extent that a repurchase agreement is secured by collateral other than cash and government securities, such as debt securities, equity securities and high yield securities that are rated below investment grade (&#8220;Alternative Collateral&#8221;). High yield securities that are used as Alternative Collateral are subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risk, and are considered primarily speculative with respect to the issuer&#8217;s continuing ability to make principal and interest payments. <br /><br />Alternative Collateral may be subject to greater price volatility and may be more volatile or less liquid than other types of collateral, increasing the risk that the fund will be unable to recover fully in the event of a counterparty&#8217;s default.<br /><br /><b>Credit Risk.</b> The fund is subject to the risk that a decline in the credit quality of a portfolio investment could cause the fund to lose money or underperform. The fund could lose money if the issuer of a portfolio investment fails to make timely principal or interest payments or if a guarantor, liquidity provider or counterparty of a portfolio investment fails to honor its obligations. Even though the fund&#8217;s investments in repurchase agreements are collateralized at all times, there is some risk to the fund if the other party should default on its obligations and the fund is delayed or prevented from recovering or disposing of the collateral. Negative perceptions of the ability of an issuer, guarantor, liquidity provider or counterparty to make payments or otherwise honor its obligations, as applicable, could also cause the price of that investment to decline. The credit quality of the fund&#8217;s portfolio holdings can change rapidly in certain market environments and any downgrade or default on the part of a single portfolio investment could cause the fund&#8217;s share price or yield to fall.<br /><br />Many of the U.S. government securities that the fund invests in are not backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government, which means they are neither issued nor guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury.

Also, any government guarantees on securities the fund owns do not extend to shares of the fund itself.<br /><br /><b>Foreign Investment Risk.</b> The fund&#8217;s investments in securities of foreign issuers or securities with credit or liquidity enhancements provided by foreign entities may involve certain risks that are greater than those associated with investments in securities of U.S. issuers or securities with credit or liquidity enhancements provided by U.S. entities. These include risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions; differing accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards and practices; differing securities market structures; and higher transaction costs. In addition, sovereign risk, or the risk that a government may become unwilling or unable to meet its loan obligations or guarantees, could increase the credit risk of financial institutions connected to that particular country.<br /><br /><b>Management Risk.</b> Any actively managed mutual fund is subject to the risk that its investment adviser will make poor security selections. The fund&#8217;s investment adviser applies its own investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment  decisions for the fund, but there can be no guarantee that they will produce the desired results. The investment adviser&#8217;s maturity decisions will also affect the fund&#8217;s yield, and in unusual circumstances potentially could affect its share price. To the extent that the investment adviser anticipates interest rate trends imprecisely, the fund&#8217;s yield at times could lag those of other money market funds.<br /><br /><b>Liquidity Risk.</b> Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell. The market for certain investments may become illiquid due to specific adverse changes in the conditions of a particular issuer or under adverse market or economic conditions independent of the issuer. The fund&#8217;s investments in illiquid securities may reduce the returns of the fund because it may be unable to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. Further, transactions in illiquid securities may entail transaction costs that are higher than those for transactions in liquid securities.<br /><br /><b>Redemption Risk.</b> The fund may experience periods of heavy redemptions that could cause the fund to liquidate its assets at inopportune times or at a loss or depressed value, particularly during periods of declining or illiquid markets. Redemptions by a few large investors in the fund may have a significant adverse effect on the fund&#8217;s ability to maintain a stable $1.00 share price. In the event any money market fund fails to maintain a stable net asset value, other money market funds, including the fund, could face a market-wide risk of increased redemption pressures, potentially jeopardizing the stability of their $1.00 share prices.<br /><br /><b>Regulatory Risk.</b> The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulators may adopt additional money market fund regulations in the future, which may impact the operation and performance of the fund.<br /><br /><b>Money Market Risk.</b> The fund is not designed to offer capital appreciation. In exchange for their emphasis on stability and liquidity, money market investments may offer lower long-term performance than stock or bond investments."

Strategy Narrative [Text Block],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004511_MemberSchwabMunicipalMoneyFund_Member,,,,,"<b>To pursue its goal, the fund invests in municipal money market securities from states and municipal agencies around the country and from U.S. territories and possessions. </b> These securities may include general obligation issues, which typically are backed by the issuer&#8217;s ability to levy taxes; revenue bonds, which typically are backed by a stream of revenue from a given source, such as a public water system or hospital; municipal commercial paper and municipal notes; and municipal leases, which may be used to finance construction or equipment purchases. The fund may invest more than 25% of its total assets in municipal securities financing similar projects such as those relating to education, health care, transportation, utilities, industrial development and housing. Under normal circumstances, the fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets in municipal money market securities the interest from which is exempt from federal income tax.<br/><br/>The fund may purchase certain variable rate demand securities issued by single state or national closed-end municipal bond funds, which, in turn, invest primarily in portfolios of tax-exempt municipal bonds. It is anticipated that the interest on the variable rate demand securities will be exempt from federal income tax. These securities are considered &#8220;municipal money market securities&#8221; for purposes of the fund&#8217;s 80% investment policy stated above.<br/><br/>Many of the fund&#8217;s securities will be subject to credit or liquidity enhancements from U.S. and/or non-U.S. entities, which are designed to provide incremental levels of creditworthiness or liquidity. Some municipal securities have been structured to resemble variable- and floating-rate securities so that they meet the requirements for being considered money market instruments.<br/><br/>In choosing securities, the fund&#8217;s manager seeks to maximize current income within the limits of the fund&#8217;s investment objective and credit, maturity and diversification policies.

Strategy Narrative [Text Block],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004511_MemberSchwabMunicipalMoneyFundValueAdvantageShares_Member,,,,,"<b>To pursue its goal, the fund invests in municipal money market securities from states and municipal agencies around the country and from U.S. territories and possessions. </b> These securities may include general obligation issues, which typically are backed by the issuer&#8217;s ability to levy taxes; revenue bonds, which typically are backed by a stream of revenue from a given source, such as a public water system or hospital; municipal commercial paper and municipal notes; and municipal leases, which may be used to finance construction or equipment purchases. The fund may invest more than 25% of its total assets in municipal securities financing similar projects such as those relating to education, health care, transportation, utilities, industrial development and housing. Under normal circumstances, the fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets in municipal money market securities the interest from which is exempt from federal income tax.<br/><br/>The fund may purchase certain variable rate demand securities issued by single state or national closed-end municipal bond funds, which, in turn, invest primarily in portfolios of tax-exempt municipal bonds. It is anticipated that the interest on the variable rate demand securities will be exempt from federal income tax. These securities are considered &#8220;municipal money market securities&#8221; for purposes of the fund&#8217;s 80% investment policy stated above.<br/><br/>Many of the fund&#8217;s securities will be subject to credit or liquidity enhancements from U.S. and/or non-U.S. entities, which are designed to provide incremental levels of creditworthiness or liquidity. Some municipal securities have been structured to resemble variable- and floating-rate securities so that they meet the requirements for being considered money market instruments.<br/><br/>In choosing securities, the fund&#8217;s manager seeks to maximize current income within the limits of the fund&#8217;s investment objective and credit, maturity and diversification policies. Some of these policies may be stricter than the federal regulations that apply to all money funds.<br/><br/>The investment adviser&#8217;s credit research department analyzes and monitors the securities that the fund owns or is considering buying. The manager may adjust the fund&#8217;s holdings or its average maturity based on actual or anticipated changes in interest rates or credit quality.

Risk [Heading],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004511_MemberSchwabMunicipalMoneyFundValueAdvantageShares_Member,,,,,<b>Principal risks </b>
Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004511_MemberSchwabMunicipalMoneyFund_Member,,,,,"The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund&#8217;s principal risks include:<br/><br/><b>Investment Risk.</b> Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.<br/><br/><b>Interest Rate Risk.</b> Interest rates rise and fall over time. As with any investment whose yield reflects current interest rates, the fund&#8217;s yield will change over time. During periods when interest rates are low, the fund&#8217;s yield (and total return) also will be low. In addition, to the extent a share class makes any reimbursement payments to the investment adviser and/or its affiliates, the share class&#8217;s yield would be lower.<br/><br/><b>Credit Risk.</b> The fund is subject to the risk that a decline in the credit quality of a portfolio investment could cause the fund to lose money or underperform. The fund could lose money if the issuer of a portfolio investment fails to make timely principal or interest payments or if a guarantor or liquidity provider of a portfolio investment fails to honor its obligations. For fixed rate investments, negative perceptions of the ability of an issuer, guarantor or liquidity provider to make payments or otherwise honor its obligations, as applicable, could also cause the price of that investment to decline. The credit quality of the fund&#8217;s portfolio holdings can change rapidly in certain market environments and any downgrade or default on the part of a single portfolio investment could cause the fund&#8217;s share price or yield to fall. The fund&#8217;s investments in securities with credit or liquidity enhancements provided by foreign entities may involve certain risks that are greater than those associated with investments in securities with credit or liquidity enhancements provided by U.S. entities. These include risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions; differing accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards and practices; differing securities market structures; and higher transaction costs. In addition, sovereign risk, or the risk that a government may become unwilling or unable to meet its loan obligations or guarantees, could increase the credit risk of financial institutions connected to that particular country.<br/><br/><b>Liquidity Support Provider Risk.</b> The fund may invest a substantial portion of its assets in securities with guarantees and/or liquidity supports provided by a bank or other financial institution, and the existence and nature of such supports may be a significant factor in the investment adviser&#8217;s decision-making process. Generally, these enhancements are employed by the issuers of the securities to reduce credit risk and provide enhanced or back-up liquidity for the purchaser, such as the fund. Adverse developments affecting these banks and financial institutions could therefore have a negative effect on the value of the fund&#8217;s holdings. For example, a rating agency downgrade of a credit or liquidity support provider may adversely affect the value of securities held by the fund. Any decline in the value of the securities held by the fund could cause the fund&#8217;s share price or yield to fall. To the extent that a portion of the fund&#8217;s underlying investments are guaranteed by the same bank or financial institution, these risks may be increased.<br/><br/><b>Management Risk.</b> Any actively managed mutual fund is subject to the risk that its investment adviser will make poor security selections. The fund&#8217;s investment adviser applies its own investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the fund, but there can be no guarantee that they will produce the desired results. The investment adviser&#8217;s maturity decisions will also affect the fund&#8217;s yield, and in unusual circumstances potentially could affect its share price. To the extent that the investment adviser anticipates interest rate trends imprecisely, the fund&#8217;s yield at times could lag those of other money market funds.<br/><br/><b>State and Regional Risk.</b> State and regional factors could affect the fund&#8217;s performance. To the extent that the fund invests in securities from a given state or geographic region, its share price and performance could be affected by local, state and regional factors, including erosion of the tax base and changes in the economic climate. National governmental actions, such as elimination of tax-exempt status, also could affect performance.<br/><br/><b>Investment Concentration Risk.</b> To the extent that the fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in municipal securities financing similar projects, the fund may be more sensitive to adverse economic, business or political developments. A change that affects one project, such as proposed legislation on the financing of the project, a shortage of materials needed for the project, or a declining need for the project, would likely affect all similar projects and the overall municipal securities market.<br/><br/><b>Taxable Determinations Risk.</b> Some of the fund&#8217;s income could be taxable. If certain types of investments the fund buys as tax-exempt are later ruled to be taxable, a portion of the fund&#8217;s income could become taxable. This risk, although generally considered low, is somewhat higher for investments that have been structured as municipal money market securities than for investments in other types of municipal money market securities. Any defensive investments in taxable securities could generate taxable income. Also, some types of municipal securities produce income that is subject to the federal alternative minimum tax (AMT).<br/><br/><b>Liquidity Risk.</b> Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell. The market for certain investments may become illiquid due to specific adverse changes in the conditions of a particular issuer or under adverse market or economic conditions independent of the issuer. The fund&#8217;s investments in illiquid securities may reduce the returns of the fund because it may be unable to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. Further, transactions in illiquid securities may entail transaction costs that are higher than those for transactions in liquid securities.<br/><br/><b>Redemption Risk.</b> The fund may experience periods of heavy redemptions that could cause the fund to liquidate its assets at inopportune times or at a loss or depressed value, particularly during periods of declining or illiquid markets. Redemptions by a few large investors in the fund may have a significant adverse effect on the fund&#8217;s ability to maintain a stable $1.00 share price. In the event any money market fund fails to maintain a stable net asset value, other money market funds, including the fund, could face a market-wide risk of increased redemption pressures, potentially jeopardizing the stability of their $1.00 share prices.<br/><br/><b>Regulatory Risk.</b> The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulators may adopt additional money market fund regulations in the future, which may impact the operation and performance of the fund.<br/><br/><b>Money Market Risk.</b> The fund is not designed to offer capital appreciation. In exchange for their emphasis on stability and liquidity, money market investments may offer lower long-term performance than stock or bond investments."

Strategy Narrative [Text Block],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004513_MemberSchwabNewYorkAmtTaxFreeMoneyFund_Member,,,,,"<b>To pursue its goal, the fund invests in money market securities from New York issuers and from municipal agencies, U.S. territories and possessions.</b> These securities may include general obligation issues, which typically are backed by the issuer&#8217;s ability to levy taxes; revenue bonds, which typically are backed by a stream of revenue from a given source, such as a public water system or hospital; municipal commercial paper and municipal notes; and municipal leases, which may be used to finance construction or equipment purchases. The fund may invest more than 25% of its total assets in municipal securities financing similar projects such as those relating to education, health care, transportation, utilities, industrial development and housing. Under normal circumstances, the fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets in municipal money market securities the interest from which is exempt from federal and New York State income tax, including the federal alternative minimum tax (AMT). The fund does not currently intend to invest in any municipal securities whose interest is subject to AMT; however, this would not prevent the fund from investing in such securities as a temporary defensive measure discussed below.<br /><br />The fund may purchase certain variable rate demand securities issued by closed-end municipal bond funds, which, in turn, invest primarily in portfolios of New York tax-exempt municipal bonds. It is anticipated that the interest on the variable rate demand  securities will be exempt from federal and New York State income tax, including the AMT. These securities are considered &#8220;municipal money market securities&#8221; for purposes of the fund&#8217;s 80% investment policy stated above.<br /><br />Many of the fund&#8217;s securities will be subject to credit or liquidity enhancements from U.S. and/or non-U.S. entities, which are designed to provide incremental levels of creditworthiness or liquidity. Some municipal securities have been structured to resemble variable- and floating-rate securities so that they meet the requirements for being considered money market instruments.<br /><br />In choosing securities, the fund&#8217;s manager seeks to maximize current income within the limits of the fund&#8217;s investment objective and credit, maturity and diversification policies. Some of these policies may be stricter than the federal regulations that apply to all money funds.<br /><br />The investment adviser&#8217;s credit research department analyzes and monitors the securities that the fund owns or is considering buying. The manager may adjust the fund&#8217;s holdings or its average maturity based on actual or anticipated changes in interest rates or credit quality. To preserve its investors&#8217; capital, the fund seeks to maintain a stable $1.00 share price.<br /><br />During unusual market conditions, the fund may invest in taxable money market securities and municipal securities whose interest is subject to the AMT as a temporary defensive measure. When the fund engages in such activities, it may not achieve its investment goal."

Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004513_MemberSchwabNewYorkAmtTaxFreeMoneyFund_Member,,,,,"The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund&#8217;s principal risks include:<br /><br /><b>Investment Risk.</b> Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.<br /><br /><b>Interest Rate Risk.</b> Interest rates rise and fall over time. As with any investment whose yield reflects current interest rates, the fund&#8217;s yield will change over time. During periods when interest rates are low, the fund&#8217;s yield (and total return) also will be low. In addition, to the extent the Value Advantage Shares make any reimbursement payments to the investment adviser and/or its affiliates, the Value Advantage Shares&#8217;s yield would be lower.<br /><br /><b>Credit Risk.</b> The fund is subject to the risk that a decline in the credit quality of a portfolio investment could cause the fund to lose money or underperform. The fund could lose money if the issuer of a portfolio investment fails to make timely principal or interest payments or if a guarantor or liquidity provider of a portfolio investment fails to honor its obligations. For fixed rate investments, negative perceptions of the ability of an issuer, guarantor or liquidity provider to make payments or otherwise honor its obligations, as applicable, could also cause the price of that investment to decline. The credit quality of the fund&#8217;s portfolio holdings can change rapidly in certain market environments and any downgrade or default on the part of a single portfolio investment could cause the fund&#8217;s share price or yield to fall. The fund&#8217;s investments in securities with credit or liquidity enhancements provided by foreign entities may involve certain risks that are greater than those associated with investments in securities with credit or liquidity enhancements provided by U.S. entities. These include risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions; differing accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards and practices; differing securities market structures; and higher transaction costs. In addition, sovereign risk, or the risk that a government may become unwilling or unable to meet its loan obligations or guarantees, could increase the credit risk of financial institutions connected to that particular country.<br /><br /><b>Liquidity Support Provider Risk.</b> The fund may invest a substantial portion of its assets in securities with guarantees and/or liquidity supports provided by a bank or other financial institution, and the existence and nature of such supports may be a significant factor in the investment adviser&#8217;s decision-making process. Generally, these enhancements are employed by the issuers of the securities to reduce credit risk and provide enhanced or back-up liquidity for the purchaser, such as the fund. Adverse developments affecting these banks and financial institutions could therefore have a negative effect on the value of the fund&#8217;s holdings. For example, a rating agency downgrade of a credit or liquidity support provider may adversely affect the value of securities held by the fund. Any decline in the value of the securities held by the fund could cause the fund&#8217;s share price or yield to fall. To the extent that a portion of the fund&#8217;s underlying investments are guaranteed by the same bank or financial institution, these risks may be increased.<br /><br /><b>Management Risk.</b> Any actively managed mutual fund is subject to the risk that its investment adviser will make poor security selections. The fund&#8217;s investment adviser applies its own investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the fund, but there can be no guarantee that they will produce the desired results. The investment adviser&#8217;s maturity decisions will also affect the fund&#8217;s yield, and in unusual circumstances potentially could affect its share price. To the extent that the investment adviser anticipates interest rate trends imprecisely, the fund&#8217;s yield at times could lag those of other money market funds.<br /><br /><b>State Risk.</b> The fund invests primarily in securities issued by the state of New York and its municipalities. Any reduction in the credit ratings of obligations of these issuers could adversely affect the market values and marketability of such securities, and, consequently, the value of the fund&#8217;s portfolio. Further, the fund&#8217;s share price and performance could be affected by local, state and regional factors, including erosion of the tax base and changes in the economic climate. Certain New York constitutional amendments, legislative measures, executive orders and administrative regulations could result in adverse consequences, affecting the state of New York and/or its municipalities. National  governmental actions, such as the elimination of tax-exempt status, also could affect performance. In addition, a municipality or municipal project that relies directly or indirectly on national governmental funding mechanisms may be negatively affected by the national government&#8217;s current budgetary constraints.<br /><br /><b>Investment Concentration Risk.</b> To the extent that the fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in municipal securities financing similar projects, the fund may be more sensitive to adverse economic, business or political developments. A change that affects one project, such as proposed legislation on the financing of the project, a shortage of materials needed for the project, or a declining need for the project, would likely affect all similar projects and the overall municipal securities market.<br /><br /><b>Taxable Determinations Risk.</b> Some of the fund&#8217;s income could be taxable. If certain types of investments the fund buys as tax-exempt are later ruled to be taxable, a portion of the fund&#8217;s income could become taxable. This risk, although generally considered low, is somewhat higher for investments that have been structured as municipal money market securities than for investments in other types of municipal money market securities. Any defensive investments in taxable securities or securities whose interest is subject to the AMT could generate taxable income.<br /><br /><b>Liquidity Risk.</b> Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell. The market for certain investments may become illiquid due to specific adverse changes in the conditions of a particular issuer or under adverse market or economic conditions independent of the issuer. The fund&#8217;s investments in illiquid securities may reduce the returns of the fund because it may be unable to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. Further, transactions in illiquid securities may entail transaction costs that are higher than those for transactions in liquid securities.<br /><br /><b>Redemption Risk.</b> The fund may experience periods of heavy redemptions that could cause the fund to liquidate its assets at inopportune times or at a loss or depressed value, particularly during periods of declining or illiquid markets. Redemptions by a few large investors in the fund may have a significant adverse effect on the fund&#8217;s ability to maintain a stable $1.00 share price. In the event any money market fund fails to maintain a stable net asset value, other money market funds, including the fund, could face a market-wide risk of increased redemption pressures, potentially jeopardizing the stability of their $1.00 share prices.<br /><br /><b>Regulatory Risk.</b> The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulators may adopt additional money market fund regulations in the future, which may impact the operation and performance of the fund.<br /><br /><b>Money Market Risk.</b> The fund is not designed to offer capital appreciation. In exchange for their emphasis on stability and liquidity, money market investments may offer lower long-term performance than stock or bond investments."

Risk [Heading],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004508_MemberSchwabValueAdvantageMoneyFund_Member,,,,,<b>Principal risks </b>
Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004508_MemberSchwabValueAdvantageMoneyFund_Member,,,,,"The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund&#8217;s principal risks include:<br/><br/><b>Investment Risk.</b> Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.<br/><br/><b>Interest Rate Risk.</b> Interest rates rise and fall over time. As with any investment whose yield reflects current interest rates, the fund&#8217;s yield will change over time. During periods when interest rates are low, the fund&#8217;s yield (and total return) also will be low. In addition, to the extent a share class makes any reimbursement payments to the investment adviser and/or its affiliates, the share class&#8217;s yield would be lower.<br/><br/><b>Repurchase Agreements Risk.</b> When the fund enters into a repurchase agreement, the fund is exposed to the risk that the other party (i.e., the counter-party) will not fulfill its contractual obligation. In a repurchase agreement, there exists the risk that, when the fund buys a security from a counter-party that agrees to repurchase the security at an agreed upon price (usually higher) and time, the counter-party will not repurchase the security. These risks are magnified to the extent that a repurchase agreement is secured by collateral other than cash and government securities, such as debt securities, equity securities and high yield securities that are rated below investment grade (&#8220;Alternative Collateral&#8221;). High yield securities that are used as alternative collateral are subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risk, and are considered primarily speculative with respect to the issuer&#8217;s continuing ability to make principal and interest payments. Alternative Collateral may be subject to greater price volatility and may be more volatile or less liquid than other types of collateral, increasing the risk that the fund will be unable to recover fully in the event of a counterparty&#8217;s default.<br/><br/><b>Credit Risk.</b> The fund is subject to the risk that a decline in the credit quality of a portfolio investment could cause the fund to lose money or underperform. The fund could lose money if the issuer of a portfolio investment fails to make timely principal or interest payments or if a guarantor, liquidity provider or counterparty of a portfolio investment fails to honor its obligations. Even though the fund&#8217;s investments in repurchase agreements are collateralized at all times, there is some risk to the fund if the other party should default on its obligations and the fund is delayed or prevented from recovering or disposing of the collateral. Negative perceptions of the ability of an issuer, guarantor, liquidity provider or counterparty to make payments or otherwise honor its obligations, as applicable, could also cause the price of that investment to decline. The credit quality of the fund&#8217;s portfolio holdings can change rapidly in certain market environments and any downgrade or default on the part of a single portfolio investment could cause the fund&#8217;s share price or yield to fall.<br/><br/>Many of the U.S. government securities that the fund invests in are not backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government, which means they are neither issued nor guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury. Although maintained in conservatorship by the Federal Housing Finance Agency since September 2008, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) maintain only limited lines of credit with the U.S. Treasury. The Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB) also only maintain limited access to credit lines from the U.S. Treasury. Other securities, such as obligations issued by the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation (FFCB), are supported solely by the credit of the issuer. There can be no assurance that the U.S. government will provide financial support to securities of its agencies and instrumentalities if it is not obligated to do so under law. Also, any government guarantees on securities the fund owns do not extend to shares of the fund itself.<br/><br/><b>Foreign Investment Risk.</b> The fund&#8217;s investments in securities of foreign issuers or securities with credit or liquidity enhancements provided by foreign entities may involve certain risks that are greater than those associated with investments in securities of U.S. issuers or securities with credit or liquidity enhancements provided by U.S. entities. These include risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions; differing accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards and practices; differing securities market structures; and higher transaction costs. In addition, sovereign risk, or the risk that a government may become unwilling or unable to meet its loan obligations or guarantees, could increase the credit risk of financial institutions connected to that particular country.<br/><br/><b>Management Risk.</b> Any actively managed mutual fund is subject to the risk that its investment adviser will make poor security selections. The fund&#8217;s investment adviser applies its own investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the fund, but there can be no guarantee that they will produce the desired results. The investment adviser&#8217;s maturity decisions will also affect the fund&#8217;s yield, and in unusual circumstances potentially could affect its share price. To the extent that the investment adviser anticipates interest  rate trends imprecisely, the fund&#8217;s yield at times could lag those of other money market funds.<br/><br/><b>Liquidity Risk.</b> Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell. The market for certain investments may become illiquid due to specific adverse changes in the conditions of a particular issuer or under adverse market or economic conditions independent of the issuer. The fund&#8217;s investments in illiquid securities may reduce the returns of the fund because it may be unable to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. Further, transactions in illiquid securities may entail transaction costs that are higher than those for transactions in liquid securities.<br/><br/><b>Redemption Risk.</b> The fund may experience periods of heavy redemptions that could cause the fund to liquidate its assets at inopportune times or at a loss or depressed value, particularly during periods of declining or illiquid markets. Redemptions by a few large investors in the fund may have a significant adverse effect on the fund&#8217;s ability to maintain a stable $1.00 share price. In the event any money market fund fails to maintain a stable net asset value, other money market funds, including the fund, could face a market-wide risk of increased redemption pressures, potentially jeopardizing the stability of their $1.00 share prices.<br/><br/><b>Regulatory Risk.</b> The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulators may adopt additional money market fund regulations in the future, which may impact the operation and performance of the fund.<br/><br/><b>Money Market Risk.</b> The fund is not designed to offer capital appreciation. In exchange for their emphasis on stability and liquidity, money market investments may offer lower long-term performance than stock or bond investments."

Strategy Narrative [Text Block],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004500_MemberSchwabAmtTaxFreeMoneyFundSweepShares_Member,,,,,"<b>To pursue its goal, the fund invests in money market securities from states and municipal agencies around the country and from U.S. territories and possessions.</b> These securities may include general obligation issues, which typically are backed by the issuer&#8217;s ability to levy taxes; revenue bonds, which typically are backed by a stream of revenue from a given source, such as a public water system or hospital; municipal commercial paper and municipal notes; and municipal leases, which may be used to finance construction or equipment purchases. The fund may invest more than 25% of its total assets in municipal securities financing similar projects such as those relating to education, health care, transportation, utilities, industrial development and housing. Under normal circumstances, the fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets in municipal money market securities whose interest is exempt from federal income tax, including the federal alternative minimum tax (AMT). The fund does not currently intend to invest in any municipal securities whose interest is subject to AMT; however, this would not prevent the fund from investing in such securities as a temporary defensive measure discussed below.  <br/><br/> The fund may purchase certain variable rate demand securities issued by single state or national closed-end municipal bond funds, which, in turn, invest primarily in portfolios of tax-exempt municipal bonds. It is anticipated that the interest on the variable rate demand securities will be exempt from federal income tax,  including the AMT. These securities are considered &#8220;municipal money market securities&#8221; for purposes of the fund&#8217;s 80% investment policy stated above. <br/><br/> Many of the fund&#8217;s securities will be subject to credit or liquidity enhancements from U.S. and/or non-U.S. entities, which are designed to provide incremental levels of creditworthiness or liquidity. Some municipal securities have been structured to resemble variable- and floating-rate securities so that they meet the requirements for being considered money market instruments.  <br/><br/> In choosing securities, the fund&#8217;s manager seeks to maximize current income within the limits of the fund&#8217;s investment objective and credit, maturity and diversification policies. Some of these policies may be stricter than the federal regulations that apply to all money funds.  <br/><br/> The investment adviser&#8217;s credit research department analyzes and monitors the securities that the fund owns or is considering buying. The manager may adjust the fund&#8217;s holdings or its average maturity based on actual or anticipated changes in interest rates or credit quality. To preserve its investors&#8217; capital, the fund seeks to maintain a stable $1.00 share price.  <br/><br/> During unusual market conditions, the fund may invest in taxable money market securities and municipal securities whose interest is subject to the AMT as a temporary defensive measure. When the fund engages in such activities, it may not achieve its investment goal."

The fund&#8217;s principal risks include:<br/><br/> <b>Investment Risk.</b> Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.<br/><br/> <b>Interest Rate Risk.</b> Interest rates rise and fall over time. As with any investment whose yield reflects current interest rates, the fund&#8217;s yield will change over time. During periods when interest rates are low, the fund&#8217;s yield (and total return) also will be low. In addition, to the extent the Sweep Shares make any reimbursement payments to the investment adviser and/or its affiliates, the Sweep Shares&#8217;s yield would be lower.<br/><br/> <b>Credit Risk.</b> The fund is subject to the risk that a decline in the credit quality of a portfolio investment could cause the fund to lose money or underperform. The fund could lose money if the issuer of a portfolio investment fails to make timely principal or interest payments or if a guarantor or liquidity provider of a portfolio investment fails to honor its obligations. For fixed rate investments, negative perceptions of the ability of an issuer, guarantor or liquidity provider to make payments or otherwise honor its obligations, as applicable, could also cause the price of that investment to decline. The credit quality of the fund&#8217;s portfolio holdings can change rapidly in certain market environments and any downgrade or default on the part of a single portfolio investment could cause the fund&#8217;s share price or yield to fall. The fund&#8217;s investments in securities with credit or liquidity enhancements provided by foreign entities may involve certain risks that are greater than those associated with investments in securities with credit or liquidity enhancements provided by U.S. entities. These include risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions; differing accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards and practices; differing securities market structures; and higher transaction costs. In addition, sovereign risk, or the risk that a government may become unwilling or unable to meet its loan obligations or guarantees, could increase the credit risk of financial institutions connected to that particular country.<br/><br/> <b>Liquidity Support Provider Risk. </b> The fund may invest a substantial portion of its assets in securities with guarantees and/or liquidity supports provided by a bank or other financial institution, and the existence and nature of such supports may be a significant factor in the investment adviser&#8217;s decision-making process. Generally, these enhancements are employed by the issuers of the securities to reduce credit risk and provide enhanced or back-up liquidity for the purchaser, such as the fund. Adverse developments affecting these banks and financial institutions could therefore have a negative effect on the value of the fund&#8217;s holdings. For example, a rating agency downgrade of a credit or liquidity support provider may adversely affect the value of securities held by the fund. Any decline in the value of the securities held by the fund could cause the fund&#8217;s share price or yield to fall. To the extent that a portion of the fund&#8217;s underlying investments are guaranteed by the same bank or financial institution, these risks may be increased.<br/><br/> <b>Management Risk.</b> Any actively managed mutual fund is subject to the risk that its investment adviser will make poor security selections. The fund&#8217;s investment adviser applies its own investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the fund, but there can be no guarantee that they will produce the desired results. The investment adviser&#8217;s maturity decisions will also affect the fund&#8217;s yield, and in unusual circumstances potentially could affect its share price. To the extent that the investment adviser anticipates interest rate trends imprecisely, the fund&#8217;s yield at times could lag those of other money market funds.<br/><br/> <b>State and Regional Risk.</b> State and regional factors could affect the fund&#8217;s performance. To the extent that the fund invests in securities from a given state or geographic region, its share price and performance could be affected by local, state and regional factors, including erosion of the tax base and changes in the economic climate. National governmental actions, such as the elimination of tax-exempt status, also could affect performance. In addition, a municipality or municipal project that relies directly or indirectly on national governmental funding mechanisms may be negatively affected by the national government&#8217;s current budgetary constraints.<br/><br/> <b>Investment Concentration Risk.</b> To the extent that the fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in municipal securities financing similar projects, the fund may be more sensitive to adverse economic, business or political developments. A change that affects one project, such as proposed legislation on the financing of the project, a shortage of materials needed for the project, or a declining need for the project, would likely affect all similar projects and the overall municipal securities market.<br/><br/> <b>Taxable Determinations Risk.</b> Some of the fund&#8217;s income could be taxable. If certain types of investments the fund buys as tax-exempt are later ruled to be taxable, a portion of the fund&#8217;s income could become taxable. This risk, although generally considered low, is somewhat higher for investments that have been structured as municipal money market securities than for investments in other types of municipal money market securities. Any defensive investments in taxable securities or securities whose interest is subject to the AMT could generate taxable income.<br/><br/> <b>Liquidity Risk.</b> Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell. The market for certain investments may become illiquid due to specific adverse changes in the conditions of a particular issuer or under adverse market or economic conditions independent of the issuer. The fund&#8217;s investments in illiquid securities may reduce the returns of the fund because it may be unable to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. Further, transactions in illiquid securities may entail transaction costs that are higher than those for transactions in liquid securities.<br/><br/> <b>Redemption Risk.</b> The fund may experience periods of heavy redemptions that could cause the fund to liquidate its assets at inopportune times or at a loss or depressed value, particularly during periods of declining or illiquid markets. Redemptions by a few large investors in the fund may have a significant adverse effect on the fund&#8217;s ability to maintain a stable $1.00 share price. In the event any money market fund fails to maintain a stable net asset value, other money market funds, including the fund, could face a market-wide risk of increased redemption pressures, potentially jeopardizing the stability of their $1.00 share prices.<br/><br/> <b>Regulatory Risk.</b> The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulators may adopt additional money market fund regulations in the future, which may impact the operation and performance of the fund.<br/><br/> <b>Money Market Risk.</b> The fund is not designed to offer capital appreciation. In exchange for their emphasis on stability and liquidity, money market investments may offer lower long-term performance than stock or bond investments."

Obligations that are issued by private issuers that are guaranteed as to principal or interest by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities are considered U.S. government securities under the rules that  govern money market funds. Certain of the fund&#8217;s securities are subject to credit or liquidity enhancements, which are designed to provide incremental levels of creditworthiness or liquidity.<br /><br />The fund may engage in repurchase agreement transactions that are collateralized by cash or U.S. government securities. In addition, the fund may engage in repurchase agreement transactions that are collateralized by money market instruments, debt securities, loan participations or other securities, including equity securities and securities that are rated below investment grade or their unrated equivalents as determined by the investment adviser.<br /><br />In choosing securities, the fund&#8217;s manager seeks to maximize current income within the limits of the fund&#8217;s investment objective and credit, maturity and diversification policies. Some of these policies may be stricter than the federal regulations that apply to all money funds.  <br/><br/>The investment adviser&#8217;s credit research department analyzes and monitors the securities that the fund owns or is considering buying. The manager may adjust the fund&#8217;s holdings or its average maturity based on actual or anticipated changes in interest rates or credit quality. To preserve its investors&#8217; capital, the fund seeks to maintain a stable $1.00 share price."
Risk [Heading],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004504_Member,,,,,<b>Principal risks</b>
Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004504_Member,,,,,"The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund&#8217;s principal risks include:<br /><br /><b>Investment Risk.</b> Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.<br /><br /><b>Interest Rate Risk.</b> Interest rates rise and fall over time. As with any investment whose yield reflects current interest rates, the fund&#8217;s yield will change over time. During periods when interest rates are low, the fund&#8217;s yield (and total return) also will be low. In addition, to the extent the fund makes any reimbursement payments to the investment adviser and/or its affiliates, the fund&#8217;s yield would be lower.<br /><br /><b>Repurchase Agreements Risk.</b> When the fund enters into a repurchase agreement, the fund is exposed to the risk that the other party (i.e., the counter-party) will not fulfill its contractual obligation. In a repurchase agreement, there exists the risk that, when the fund buys a security from a counter-party that agrees to repurchase the security at an agreed upon price (usually higher) and time, the counter-party will not repurchase the security. These risks are magnified to the extent that a repurchase agreement is secured by collateral other than cash and government securities, such as debt securities, equity securities and high yield securities that are rated below investment grade (&#8220;Alternative Collateral&#8221;). High yield securities that are used as Alternative Collateral are subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risk, and are considered primarily speculative with respect to the issuer&#8217;s continuing ability to make principal and interest payments. Alternative Collateral may be subject to greater price volatility and may be more volatile or less liquid than other types of collateral, increasing the risk that the fund will be unable to recover fully in the event of a counterparty&#8217;s default.<br /><br /><b>Credit Risk.</b> The fund is subject to the risk that a decline in the credit quality of a portfolio investment could cause the fund to lose money or underperform. The fund could lose money if the issuer of a portfolio investment fails to make timely principal or interest payments or if a guarantor, liquidity provider or counterparty of a portfolio investment fails to honor its obligations. Even though the fund&#8217;s investments in repurchase agreements are collateralized at all times, there is some risk to the fund if the other party should default on its obligations and the fund is delayed or prevented from recovering or disposing of the collateral. The negative perceptions of the ability of an issuer, guarantor, liquidity provider or counterparty to make payments or otherwise honor its obligations, as applicable, could also cause the price of that investment to decline. The credit quality of the fund&#8217;s portfolio holdings can change rapidly in certain market environments and any downgrade or default on the part of a single portfolio investment could cause the fund&#8217;s share price or yield to fall.<br /><br />Many of the U.S. government securities that the fund invests in are not backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government, which means they are neither issued nor guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury. Although maintained in conservatorship by the Federal Housing Finance Agency since September 2008, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) maintain only limited lines of credit with the U.S. Treasury. The Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB) also only maintain limited access to credit lines from the U.S. Treasury. Other securities, such as obligations issued by the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation (FFCB), are supported solely by the credit of the issuer. There can be no assurance that the U.S. government will provide financial support to securities of its agencies and instrumentalities if it is not obligated to do so under law. Also, any government guarantees on securities the fund owns do not extend to the shares of the fund itself.<br /><br /><b>Foreign Investment Risk.</b> The fund&#8217;s investments in securities of foreign issuers or securities with credit or liquidity enhancements provided by foreign entities may involve certain risks that are greater than those associated with investments in securities of U.S. issuers or securities with credit or liquidity enhancements provided by U.S. entities. These include risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions; differing accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards and practices; differing securities market structures; and higher transaction costs. In addition, sovereign risk, or the risk that a government may become unwilling or unable to meet its loan obligations or guarantees, could increase the credit risk of financial institutions connected to that particular country.<br /><br /><b>Management Risk.</b> Any actively managed mutual fund is subject to the risk that its investment adviser will make poor security selections. The fund&#8217;s investment adviser applies its own  investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the fund, but there can be no guarantee that they will produce the desired results.

Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004510_Member,,,,,"The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund&#8217;s principal risks include:<br/><br/><b>Investment Risk.</b> Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.<br/><br/><b>Interest Rate Risk.</b> Interest rates rise and fall over time. As with any investment whose yield reflects current interest rates, the fund&#8217;s yield will change over time. During periods when interest rates are low, the fund&#8217;s yield (and total return) also will be low. In addition, to the extent the fund makes any reimbursement payments to the investment adviser and/or its affiliates, the fund&#8217;s yield would be lower.<br/><br/><b>Repurchase Agreements Risk.</b> When the fund enters into a repurchase agreement, the fund is exposed to the risk that the other party (i.e., the counter-party) will not fulfill its contractual obligation. In a repurchase agreement, there exists the risk that, when the fund buys a security from a counter-party that agrees to repurchase the security at an agreed upon price (usually higher) and time, the counter-party will not repurchase the security. These risks are magnified to the extent that a repurchase agreement is secured by collateral other than cash and government securities, such as debt securities, equity securities and high yield securities that are rated below investment grade (&#8220;Alternative Collateral&#8221;). High yield securities that are used as Alternative Collateral are subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risk, and are considered primarily speculative with respect to the issuer&#8217;s continuing ability to make principal and interest payments. Alternative Collateral may be subject to greater price volatility and may be more volatile or less liquid than other types of collateral, increasing the risk that the fund will be unable to recover fully in the event of a counterparty&#8217;s default.<br/><br/><b>Credit Risk.</b> The fund is subject to the risk that a decline in the credit quality of a portfolio investment could cause the fund to lose money or underperform. The fund could lose money if the issuer of a portfolio investment fails to make timely principal or interest payments or if a guarantor, liquidity provider or counterparty of a portfolio investment fails to honor its obligations. Even though the fund&#8217;s investments in repurchase agreements are collateralized at all times, there is some risk to the fund if the other party should default on its obligations and the fund is delayed or prevented from recovering or disposing of the collateral. Negative perceptions of the ability of an issuer, guarantor, liquidity provider or counterparty to make payments or otherwise honor its obligations, as applicable, could also cause the price of that investment to decline. The credit quality of the fund&#8217;s portfolio holdings can change rapidly in certain market environments and any downgrade or default on the part of a single portfolio investment could cause the fund&#8217;s share price or yield to fall.<br/><br/>Many of the U.S. government securities that the fund invests in are not backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government, which means they are neither issued nor guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury. Although maintained in conservatorship by the Federal Housing Finance Agency since September 2008, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) maintain only limited lines of credit with the U.S. Treasury. The Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB) also only maintain limited access to credit lines from the U.S. Treasury. Other securities, such as obligations issued by the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation (FFCB), are supported solely by the credit of the issuer. There can be no assurance that the U.S. government will provide financial support to securities of its agencies and instrumentalities if it is not obligated to do so under law. Also, any government guarantees on securities the fund owns do not extend to shares of the fund itself.<br/><br/><b>Foreign Investment Risk.</b> The fund&#8217;s investments in securities of foreign issuers or securities with credit or liquidity enhancements provided by foreign entities may involve certain risks that are greater than those associated with investments in securities of U.S. issuers or securities with credit or liquidity enhancements provided by U.S. entities. These include risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions; differing accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards and practices; differing securities market structures; and higher transaction costs. In addition, sovereign risk, or the risk that a government may become unwilling or unable to meet its loan obligations or guarantees, could increase the credit risk of financial institutions connected to that particular country.<br/><br/><b>Management Risk.</b> Any actively managed mutual fund is subject to the risk that its investment adviser will make poor security selections. The fund&#8217;s investment adviser applies its own investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the fund, but there can be no guarantee that they will produce the desired results. The investment adviser&#8217;s maturity decisions will also affect the fund&#8217;s yield, and in unusual circumstances potentially could affect its share price. To the extent that the investment adviser anticipates interest rate trends imprecisely, the fund&#8217;s yield at times could lag those of other money market funds.<br/><br/><b>Liquidity Risk.</b> Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell. The market for certain investments may become illiquid due to specific adverse changes in the conditions of a particular issuer or under adverse market or economic conditions independent of the issuer. The fund&#8217;s investments in illiquid securities may reduce the returns of the fund because it may be unable to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. Further, transactions in illiquid securities may entail transaction costs that are higher than those for transactions in liquid securities.<br/><br/><b>Redemption Risk.</b> The fund may experience periods of heavy redemptions that could cause the fund to liquidate its assets at inopportune times or at a loss or depressed value, particularly during periods of declining or illiquid markets. Redemptions by a few large investors in the fund may have a significant adverse effect on the fund&#8217;s ability to maintain a stable $1.00 share price. In the event any money market fund fails to maintain a stable net asset value, other money market funds, including the fund, could face a market-wide risk of increased redemption pressures, potentially jeopardizing the stability of their $1.00 share prices.<br/><br/><b>Regulatory Risk.</b> The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulators may adopt additional money market fund regulations in the future, which may impact the operation and performance of the fund.<br/><br/><b>Money Market Risk.</b> The fund is not designed to offer capital appreciation. In exchange for their emphasis on stability and liquidity, money market investments may offer lower long-term performance than stock or bond investments."

In addition, to the extent the fund makes any reimbursement payments to the investment adviser and/or its affiliates, the fund&#8217;s yield would be lower. <br/><br/><b>Credit Risk.</b> The fund is subject to the risk that a decline in the credit quality of a portfolio investment could cause the fund to lose money or underperform. The fund could lose money if the issuer or guarantor of a portfolio investment fails to make timely principal or interest payments or otherwise honor its obligations. Even though the fund&#8217;s investments in repurchase agreements are collateralized at all times, there is some risk to the fund if the other party should default on its obligations and the fund is delayed or prevented from recovering or disposing of the collateral. Negative perceptions of the ability of an issuer or guarantor to make payments or otherwise honor its obligations could also cause the price of that investment to downgrade or decline. The credit quality of the fund&#8217;s portfolio holdings can change rapidly in certain market environments and any default on the part of a single portfolio investment could cause the fund&#8217;s share price or yield to fall. Certain U.S. government securities that the fund may invest in are not backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government, which means they are neither issued nor guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury. Although maintained in conservatorship by the Federal Housing Finance Agency since September 2008, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) maintain only limited lines of credit with the U.S. Treasury. The Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB) also only maintain limited access to credit lines from the U.S. Treasury. Other securities, such as obligations issued by the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation (FFCB), are supported solely by the credit of the issuer. There can be no assurance that the U.S. government will provide financial support to securities of its agencies and instrumentalities if it is not obligated to do so under law. Also, any government guarantees on securities the fund owns do not extend to shares of the fund itself. <br/><br/><b>Repurchase Agreements Risk.</b> When the fund enters into a repurchase agreement, the fund is exposed to the risk that the other party (i.e., the counter-party) will not fulfill its contractual obligation. In a repurchase agreement, there exists the risk that when the fund buys a security from a counter-party that agrees to repurchase the security at an agreed upon price (usually higher) and time, the counter-party will not repurchase the security. <br/><br/><b>Management Risk.</b> Any actively managed mutual fund is subject to the risk that its investment adviser will make poor security selections. The fund&#8217;s investment adviser applies its own investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the fund, but there can be no guarantee that they will produce the desired results. The investment adviser&#8217;s maturity decisions will also affect the fund&#8217;s yield, and in unusual circumstances potentially could affect its share price. To the extent that the investment adviser anticipates interest rate trends imprecisely, the fund&#8217;s yield at times could lag those of other money market funds. <br/><br/><b>Liquidity Risk.</b> Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell. The market for certain investments may become illiquid due to specific adverse changes in the conditions of a particular issuer or under adverse market or economic conditions independent of the issuer. The fund&#8217;s investments in illiquid securities may reduce the returns of the fund because it may be unable to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. Further, transactions in illiquid securities may entail transaction costs that are higher than those for transactions in liquid securities. <br/><br/><b>Redemption Risk. </b>The fund may experience periods of heavy redemptions that could cause the fund to liquidate its assets at inopportune times or at a loss or depressed value, particularly during periods of declining or illiquid markets. Redemptions by a few large investors in the fund may have a significant adverse effect on the fund&#8217;s ability to maintain a stable $1.00 share price. In the event any money market fund fails to maintain a stable net asset value, other money market funds, including the fund, could face a market-wide risk of increased redemption pressures, potentially jeopardizing the stability of their $1.00 share prices. <br/><br/><b>Regulatory Risk. </b>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulators may adopt additional money market fund regulations in the future, which may impact the operation and the performance of the fund. <br/><br/><b>Money Market Risk.</b> The fund is not designed to offer capital appreciation. In exchange for their emphasis on stability and liquidity, money market investments may offer lower long-term performance than stock or bond investments."

Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004511_MemberSchwabMunicipalMoneyFundSweepShares_Member,,,,,"The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund&#8217;s principal risks include:<br /><br /><b>Investment Risk. </b> Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.<br /><br /><b>Interest Rate Risk. </b> Interest rates rise and fall over time. As with any investment whose yield reflects current interest rates, the fund&#8217;s yield will change over time. During periods when interest rates are low, the fund&#8217;s yield (and total return) also will be low. In addition, to the extent the Sweep Shares make any reimbursement payments to the investment adviser and/or its affiliates, the Sweep Shares&#8217;s yield would be lower.<br /><br /><b>Credit Risk.</b> The fund is subject to the risk that a decline in the credit quality of a portfolio investment could cause the fund to lose money or underperform. The fund could lose money if the issuer of a portfolio investment fails to make timely principal or interest payments or if a guarantor or liquidity provider of a portfolio investment fails to honor its obligations. For fixed rate investments, negative perceptions of the ability of an issuer, guarantor or liquidity provider to make payments or otherwise honor its obligations, as applicable, could also cause the price of that investment to decline. The credit quality of the fund&#8217;s portfolio holdings can change rapidly in certain market environments and any downgrade or default on the part of a single portfolio investment could cause the fund&#8217;s share price or yield to fall. The fund&#8217;s investments in securities with credit or liquidity enhancements provided by foreign entities may involve certain risks that are greater than those associated with investments in securities with credit or liquidity enhancements provided by U.S. entities. These include risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions; differing accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards and practices; differing securities market structures; and higher transaction costs. In addition, sovereign risk, or the risk that a government may become unwilling or unable to meet its loan obligations or guarantees, could increase the credit risk of financial institutions connected to that particular country.<br /><br /><b>Liquidity Support Provider Risk. </b> The fund may invest a substantial portion of its assets in securities with guarantees and/or liquidity supports provided by a bank or other financial institution, and the existence and nature of such supports may be a significant factor in the investment adviser&#8217;s decision-making process. Generally, these enhancements are employed by the issuers of the securities to reduce credit risk and provide enhanced or back-up liquidity for the purchaser, such as the fund. Adverse developments affecting these banks and financial institutions could therefore have a negative effect on the value of the fund&#8217;s holdings. For example, a rating agency downgrade of a credit or liquidity support provider may adversely affect the value of securities held by the fund. Any decline in the value of the securities held by the fund could cause the fund&#8217;s share price or yield to fall. To the extent that a portion of the fund&#8217;s underlying investments are guaranteed by the same bank or financial institution, these risks may be increased.<br /><br /><b>Management Risk. </b> Any actively managed mutual fund is subject to the risk that its investment adviser will make poor security selections. The fund&#8217;s investment adviser applies its own investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the fund, but there can be no guarantee that they will produce the desired results. The investment adviser&#8217;s maturity decisions will also affect the fund&#8217;s yield, and in unusual circumstances potentially could affect its share price. To the extent that the investment adviser anticipates interest rate trends imprecisely, the fund&#8217;s yield at times could lag those of other money market funds.<br /><br /><b>State and Regional Risk. </b> State and regional factors could affect the fund&#8217;s performance. To the extent that the fund invests in securities from a given state or geographic region, its share price and performance could be affected by local, state and regional factors, including erosion of the tax base and changes in the economic climate. National governmental actions, such as the elimination of tax-exempt status, also could affect performance. In addition, a municipality or municipal project that relies directly or indirectly on national governmental funding mechanisms may be negatively affected by the national government&#8217;s current budgetary constraints.<br /><br /><b>Investment Concentration Risk. </b> To the extent that the fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in municipal securities financing similar projects, the fund may be more sensitive to adverse economic, business or political developments. A change that affects one project, such as proposed legislation on the financing of the  project, a shortage of materials needed for the project, or a declining need for the project, would likely affect all similar projects and the overall municipal securities market.<br /><br /><b>Taxable Determinations Risk. </b> Some of the fund&#8217;s income could be taxable. If certain types of investments the fund buys as tax-exempt are later ruled to be taxable, a portion of the fund&#8217;s income could become taxable. This risk, although generally considered low, is somewhat higher for investments that have been structured as municipal money market securities than for investments in other types of municipal money market securities. Any defensive investment in taxable securities could generate taxable income. Also, some types of municipal securities produce income that is subject to the federal alternative minimum tax (AMT).<br /><br /><b>Liquidity Risk. </b> Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell. The market for certain investments may become illiquid due to specific adverse changes in the conditions of a particular issuer or under adverse market or economic conditions independent of the issuer. The fund&#8217;s investments in illiquid securities may reduce the returns of the fund because it may be unable to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. Further, transactions in illiquid securities may entail transaction costs that are higher than those for transactions in liquid securities.<br /><br /><b>Redemption Risk. </b> The fund may experience periods of heavy redemptions that could cause the fund to liquidate its assets at inopportune times or at a loss or depressed value, particularly during periods of declining or illiquid markets. Redemptions by a few large investors in the fund may have a significant adverse effect on the fund&#8217;s ability to maintain a stable $1.00 share price. In the event any money market fund fails to maintain a stable net asset value, other money market funds, including the fund, could face a market-wide risk of increased redemption pressures, potentially jeopardizing the stability of their $1.00 share prices.<br /><br /><b>Regulatory Risk.</b> The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulators may adopt additional money market fund regulations in the future, which may impact the operation and performance of the fund.<br /><br /><b>Money Market Risk. </b> The fund is not designed to offer capital appreciation. In exchange for their emphasis on stability and liquidity, money market investments may offer lower long-term performance than stock or bond investments."

Strategy Narrative [Text Block],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004509_Member,,,,,"<b>To pursue its goal, the fund invests in high-quality short-term money market investments issued by U.S. and foreign issuers, such as:</b><ul><li>commercial paper, including asset-backed commercial paper</li></ul><ul><li>promissory notes</li></ul><ul><li> certificates of deposit and time deposits</li></ul><ul><li> variable- and floating-rate debt securities</li></ul><ul><li> bank notes and bankers&#8217; acceptances</li></ul><ul><li> repurchase agreements</li></ul><ul><li> obligations that are issued by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities, including obligations that are not guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury, such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (U.S. government securities)</li></ul>All of these investments will be denominated in U.S. dollars, including those that are issued by foreign issuers. Obligations that are issued by private issuers that are guaranteed as to principal or interest by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities are considered U.S. government securities under the rules that govern money market funds. Certain of the fund&#8217;s securities are subject to credit or liquidity enhancements, which are designed to provide incremental levels of creditworthiness or liquidity.<br /><br />The fund may engage in repurchase agreement transactions that are collateralized by cash or U.S. government securities. In addition, the fund may engage in repurchase agreement transactions that are collateralized by money market instruments, debt securities, loan  participations or other securities, including equity securities and securities that are rated below investment grade or their unrated equivalents as determined by the investment adviser.<br /><br />In choosing securities, the fund&#8217;s manager seeks to maximize current income within the limits of the fund&#8217;s investment objective and credit, maturity and diversification policies. Some of these policies may be stricter than the federal regulations that apply to all money funds.<br /><br />The investment adviser&#8217;s credit research department analyzes and monitors the securities that the fund owns or is considering buying. The manager may adjust the fund&#8217;s holdings or its average maturity based on actual or anticipated changes in interest rates or credit quality. To preserve its investors&#8217; capital, the fund seeks to maintain a stable $1.00 share price.<br /><br />This fund was created for retirement plans, plan participants and other institutional investors investing on their own behalf or as a fiduciary, agent or custodian."
Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004509_Member,,,,,"The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund&#8217;s principal risks include:<br /><br /> <b>Investment Risk.</b> Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.<br /><br /> <b>Interest Rate Risk.</b> Interest rates rise and fall over time. As with any investment whose yield reflects current interest rates, the fund&#8217;s yield will change over time. During periods when interest rates are low, the fund&#8217;s yield (and total return) also will be low. In addition, to the extent the fund makes any reimbursement payments to the investment adviser and/or its affiliates, the fund&#8217;s yield would be lower.<br /><br /> <b>Repurchase Agreements Risk.</b> When the fund enters into a repurchase agreement, the fund is exposed to the risk that the other party (i.e., the counter-party) will not fulfill its contractual obligation. In a repurchase agreement, there exists the risk that, when the fund buys a security from a counter-party that agrees to repurchase the security at an agreed upon price (usually higher) and time, the counter-party will not repurchase the security. These risks are magnified to the extent that a repurchase agreement is secured by collateral other than cash and government securities, such as debt securities, equity securities and high yield securities that are rated below investment grade (&#8220;Alternative Collateral&#8221;). High yield securities that are used as Alternative Collateral are subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risk, and are considered primarily speculative with respect to the issuer&#8217;s continuing ability to make principal and interest payments. Alternative Collateral may be subject to greater price volatility and may be more volatile or less liquid than other types of collateral, increasing the risk that the fund will be unable to recover fully in the event of a counterparty&#8217;s default.<br /><br /> <b>Credit Risk.</b> The fund is subject to the risk that a decline in the credit quality of a portfolio investment could cause the fund to lose money or underperform. The fund could lose money if the issuer of a portfolio investment fails to make timely principal or interest payments or if a guarantor, liquidity provider or counterparty of a portfolio investment fails to honor its obligations. Even though the fund&#8217;s investments in repurchase agreements are collateralized at all times, there is some risk to the fund if the other party should default on its obligations and the fund is delayed or prevented from recovering or disposing of the collateral. Negative perceptions of the ability of an issuer, guarantor, liquidity provider or counterparty to make payments or otherwise honor its obligations, as applicable, could also cause the price of that investment to decline. The credit quality of the fund&#8217;s portfolio holdings can change rapidly in certain market environments and any downgrade or default on the part of a single portfolio investment could cause the fund&#8217;s share price or yield to fall.  <br /><br /> Many of the U.S. government securities that the fund invests in are not backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government, which means they are neither issued nor guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury. Although maintained in conservatorship by the Federal Housing Finance Agency since September 2008, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) maintain only limited lines of credit with the U.S. Treasury. The Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB) also only maintain limited access to credit lines from the U.S. Treasury. Other securities, such as obligations issued by the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation (FFCB), are supported solely by the credit of the issuer. There can be no assurance that the U.S. government will provide financial support to securities of its agencies and instrumentalities if it is not obligated to do so under law. Also, any government guarantees on securities the fund owns do not extend to shares of the fund itself.<br /><br /> <b>Foreign Investment Risk.</b> The fund&#8217;s investments in securities of foreign issuers or securities with credit or liquidity enhancements provided by foreign entities may involve certain risks that are greater than those associated with investments in securities of U.S. issuers or securities with credit or liquidity enhancements provided by U.S. entities. These include risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions; differing accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards and practices; differing securities market structures; and higher transaction costs. In addition, sovereign risk, or the risk that a government may become unwilling or unable to meet its loan obligations or guarantees, could increase the credit risk of financial institutions connected to that particular country.<br /><br /> <b>Management Risk.</b> Any actively managed mutual fund is subject to the risk that its investment adviser will make poor security selections. The fund&#8217;s investment adviser applies its own investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the fund, but there can be no guarantee that they will produce the desired results. The investment adviser&#8217;s maturity decisions will also affect the fund&#8217;s yield, and in unusual circumstances potentially  could affect its share price. To the extent that the investment adviser anticipates interest rate trends imprecisely, the fund&#8217;s yield at times could lag those of other money market funds.<br /><br /> <b>Liquidity Risk.</b> Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell. The market for certain investments may become illiquid due to specific adverse changes in the conditions of a particular issuer or under adverse market or economic conditions independent of the issuer. The fund&#8217;s investments in illiquid securities may reduce the returns of the fund because it may be unable to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. Further, transactions in illiquid securities may entail transaction costs that are higher than those for transactions in liquid securities.<br /><br /> <b>Redemption Risk.</b> The fund may experience periods of heavy redemptions that could cause the fund to liquidate its assets at inopportune times or at a loss or depressed value, particularly during periods of declining or illiquid markets. Redemptions by a few large investors in the fund may have a significant adverse effect on the fund&#8217;s ability to maintain a stable $1.00 share price. In the event any money market fund fails to maintain a stable net asset value, other money market funds, including the fund, could face a market-wide risk of increased redemption pressures, potentially jeopardizing the stability of their $1.00 share prices.<br /><br /> <b>Regulatory Risk.</b> The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulators may adopt additional money market fund regulations in the future, which may impact the operation and performance of the fund.<br /><br /> <b>Money Market Risk.</b> The fund is not designed to offer capital appreciation. In exchange for their emphasis on stability and liquidity, money market investments may offer lower long-term performance than stock or bond investments."

Strategy Narrative [Text Block],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004513_MemberSchwabNewYorkAMTTaxFreeMoneyFundSweepShares_Member,,,,,"<b>To pursue its goal, the fund invests in money market securities from New York issuers and from municipal agencies, U.S. territories and possessions.</b> These securities may include general obligation issues, which typically are backed by the issuer&#8217;s ability to levy taxes; revenue bonds, which typically are backed by a stream of revenue from a given source, such as a public water system or hospital; municipal commercial paper and municipal notes; and municipal leases, which may be used to finance construction or equipment purchases. The fund may invest more than 25% of its total assets in municipal securities financing similar projects such as those relating to education, health care, transportation, utilities, industrial development and housing. Under normal circumstances, the fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets in municipal money market securities the interest from which is exempt from federal and New York State income tax, including the federal alternative minimum tax (AMT). The fund does not currently intend to invest in any municipal securities whose interest is subject to AMT; however, this would not prevent the fund from investing in such securities as a temporary defensive measure discussed below.<br/><br/>The fund may purchase certain variable rate demand securities issued by closed-end municipal bond funds, which, in turn, invest primarily in portfolios of New York tax-exempt municipal bonds. It is anticipated that the interest on the variable rate demand  securities will be exempt from federal and New York State income tax, including the AMT. These securities are considered &#8220;municipal money market securities&#8221; for purposes of the fund&#8217;s 80% investment policy stated above.<br/><br/>Many of the fund&#8217;s securities will be subject to credit or liquidity enhancements from U.S. and/or non-U.S. entities, which are designed to provide incremental levels of creditworthiness or liquidity. Some municipal securities have been structured to resemble variable- and floating-rate securities so that they meet the requirements for being considered money market instruments.<br/><br/>In choosing securities, the fund&#8217;s manager seeks to maximize current income within the limits of the fund&#8217;s investment objective and credit, maturity and diversification policies. Some of these policies may be stricter than the federal regulations that apply to all money funds.<br/><br/>The investment adviser&#8217;s credit research department analyzes and monitors the securities that the fund owns or is considering buying. The manager may adjust the fund&#8217;s holdings or its average maturity based on actual or anticipated changes in interest rates or credit quality. To preserve its investors&#8217; capital, the fund seeks to maintain a stable $1.00 share price.<br/><br/>During unusual market conditions, the fund may invest in taxable money market securities and municipal securities whose interest is subject to the AMT as a temporary defensive measure.

Risk [Heading],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004513_MemberSchwabNewYorkAMTTaxFreeMoneyFundSweepShares_Member,,,,,<b>Principal risks </b>
Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004513_MemberSchwabNewYorkAMTTaxFreeMoneyFundSweepShares_Member,,,,,"The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund&#8217;s principal risks include:<br/><br/><b>Investment Risk.</b> Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.<br/><br/><b>Interest Rate Risk.</b> Interest rates rise and fall over time. As with any investment whose yield reflects current interest rates, the fund&#8217;s yield will change over time. During periods when interest rates are low, the fund&#8217;s yield (and total return) also will be low. In addition, to the extent the Sweep Shares make any reimbursement payments to the investment adviser and/or its affiliates, the Sweep Shares&#8217;s yield would be lower.<br/><br/><b>Credit Risk.</b> The fund is subject to the risk that a decline in the credit quality of a portfolio investment could cause the fund to lose money or underperform. The fund could lose money if the issuer of a portfolio investment fails to make timely principal or interest payments or if a guarantor or liquidity provider of a portfolio investment fails to honor its obligations. For fixed rate investments, negative perceptions of the ability of an issuer, guarantor or liquidity provider to make payments or otherwise honor its obligations, as applicable, could also cause the price of that investment to decline. The credit quality of the fund&#8217;s portfolio holdings can change rapidly in certain market environments and any downgrade or default on the part of a single portfolio investment could cause the fund&#8217;s share price or yield to fall. The fund&#8217;s investments in securities with credit or liquidity enhancements provided by foreign entities may involve certain risks that are greater than those associated with investments in securities with credit or liquidity enhancements provided by U.S. entities. These include risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions; differing accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards and practices; differing securities market structures; and higher transaction costs. In addition, sovereign risk, or the risk that a government may become unwilling or unable to meet its loan obligations or guarantees, could increase the credit risk of financial institutions connected to that particular country.<br/><br/><b>Liquidity Support Provider Risk.</b> The fund may invest a substantial portion of its assets in securities with guarantees and/or liquidity supports provided by a bank or other financial institution, and the existence and nature of such supports may be a significant factor in the investment adviser&#8217;s decision-making process. Generally, these enhancements are employed by the issuers of the securities to reduce credit risk and provide enhanced or back-up liquidity for the purchaser, such as the fund. Adverse developments affecting these banks and financial institutions could therefore have a negative effect on the value of the fund&#8217;s holdings. For example, a rating agency downgrade of a credit or liquidity support provider may adversely affect the value of securities held by the fund. Any decline in the value of the securities held by the fund could cause the fund&#8217;s share price or yield to fall. To the extent that a portion of the fund&#8217;s underlying investments are guaranteed by the same bank or financial institution, these risks may be increased.<br/><br/><b>Management Risk.</b> Any actively managed mutual fund is subject to the risk that its investment adviser will make poor security selections. The fund&#8217;s investment adviser applies its own investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the fund, but there can be no guarantee that they will produce the desired results. The investment adviser&#8217;s maturity decisions will also affect the fund&#8217;s yield, and in unusual circumstances potentially could affect its share price. To the extent that the investment adviser anticipates interest rate trends imprecisely, the fund&#8217;s yield at times could lag those of other money market funds.<br/><br/><b>State Risk.</b> The fund invests primarily in securities issued by the state of New York and its municipalities. Any reduction in the credit ratings of obligations of these issuers could adversely affect the market values and marketability of such securities, and, consequently, the value of the fund&#8217;s portfolio. Further, the fund&#8217;s share price and performance could be affected by local, state and regional factors, including erosion of the tax base and changes in the economic climate. Certain New York constitutional amendments, legislative measures, executive orders and administrative regulations could result in adverse consequences, affecting the state of New York and/or its municipalities. National  governmental actions, such as the elimination of tax-exempt status, also could affect performance. In addition, a municipality or municipal project that relies directly or indirectly on national governmental funding mechanisms may be negatively affected by the national government&#8217;s current budgetary constraints.<br/><br/><b>Investment Concentration Risk.</b> To the extent that the fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in municipal securities financing similar projects, the fund may be more sensitive to adverse economic, business or political developments. A change that affects one project, such as proposed legislation on the financing of the project, a shortage of materials needed for the project, or a declining need for the project, would likely affect all similar projects and the overall municipal securities market.<br/><br/><b>Taxable Determinations Risk.</b> Some of the fund&#8217;s income could be taxable. If certain types of investments the fund buys as tax-exempt are later ruled to be taxable, a portion of the fund&#8217;s income could become taxable. This risk, although generally considered low, is somewhat higher for investments that have been structured as municipal money market securities than for investments in other types of municipal money market securities. Any defensive investments in taxable securities or securities whose interest is subject to the AMT could generate taxable income.<br/><br/><b>Liquidity Risk.</b> Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell. The market for certain investments may become illiquid due to specific adverse changes in the conditions of a particular issuer or under adverse market or economic conditions independent of the issuer. The fund&#8217;s investments in illiquid securities may reduce the returns of the fund because it may be unable to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. Further, transactions in illiquid securities may entail transaction costs that are higher than those for transactions in liquid securities.<br/><br/><b>Redemption Risk.</b> The fund may experience periods of heavy redemptions that could cause the fund to liquidate its assets at inopportune times or at a loss or depressed value, particularly during periods of declining or illiquid markets. Redemptions by a few large investors in the fund may have a significant adverse effect on the fund&#8217;s ability to maintain a stable $1.00 share price. In the event any money market fund fails to maintain a stable net asset value, other money market funds, including the fund, could face a market-wide risk of increased redemption pressures, potentially jeopardizing the stability of their $1.00 share prices.<br/><br/><b>Regulatory Risk.</b> The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulators may adopt additional money market fund regulations in the future, which may impact the operation and performance of the fund.<br/><br/><b>Money Market Risk.</b> The fund is not designed to offer capital appreciation. In exchange for their emphasis on stability and liquidity, money market investments may offer lower long-term performance than stock or bond investments."

Strategy Narrative [Text Block],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004503_Member,,,,,"<b>To pursue its goal, the fund invests in money market securities from New Jersey issuers and from municipal agencies, U.S. territories and possessions.</b> These securities may include general obligation issues, which typically are backed by the issuer&#8217;s ability to levy taxes; revenue bonds, which typically are backed by a stream of revenue from a given source, such as a public water system or hospital; municipal commercial paper and municipal notes; and municipal leases, which may be used to finance construction or equipment purchases. The fund may invest more than 25% of its total assets in municipal securities financing similar projects such as those relating to education, health care, transportation, utilities, industrial development and housing. Under normal circumstances, the fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets in municipal money market securities the interest from which is exempt from federal and New Jersey gross income tax, including the federal alternative minimum tax (AMT). The fund may also invest in municipal securities of issuers located outside of New Jersey. The fund does not currently intend to invest in any municipal securities whose interest is subject to AMT; however, this would not prevent the fund from investing in such securities as a temporary defensive measure discussed below. <br/><br/> The fund may purchase certain variable rate demand securities issued by closed-end municipal bond funds, which, in turn, invest primarily in portfolios of New Jersey tax-exempt municipal bonds. It is anticipated that the interest on the variable rate demand securities will be exempt from federal and New Jersey gross income tax, including the AMT. These securities are considered &#8220;municipal money market securities&#8221; for purposes of the fund&#8217;s 80% investment policy stated above.  <br/><br/> Many of the fund&#8217;s securities will be subject to credit or liquidity enhancements from U.S. and/or non-U.S. entities, which are designed to provide incremental levels of creditworthiness or liquidity. Some municipal securities have been structured to resemble variable- and floating-rate securities so that they meet the requirements for being considered money market instruments.  <br/><br/> In choosing securities, the fund&#8217;s manager seeks to maximize current income within the limits of the fund&#8217;s investment objective and credit, maturity and diversification policies. Some of these policies may be stricter than the federal regulations that apply to all money funds.  <br/><br/> The investment adviser&#8217;s credit research department analyzes and monitors the securities that the fund owns or is considering buying. The manager may adjust the fund&#8217;s holdings or its average maturity based on actual or anticipated changes in interest rates or credit quality. To preserve its investors&#8217; capital, the fund seeks to maintain a stable $1.00 share price.  <br/><br/> During unusual market conditions, the fund may invest in taxable money market securities and municipal securities whose interest is subject to the AMT as a temporary defensive measure. When the fund engages in such activities, it may not achieve its investment goal."

Risk Not Insured Depository Institution [Text],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004513_MemberSchwabNewYorkAMTTaxFreeMoneyFundSweepShares_Member,,,,,Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.
Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004503_Member,,,,,"The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund&#8217;s principal risks include:<br/><br/> <b>Investment Risk.</b> Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.<br/><br/> <b>Interest Rate Risk.</b> Interest rates rise and fall over time. As with any investment whose yield reflects current interest rates, the fund&#8217;s yield will change over time. During periods when interest rates are low, the fund&#8217;s yield (and total return) also will be low. In addition, to the extent the Sweep Shares make any reimbursement payments to the investment adviser and/or its affiliates, the Sweep Shares&#8217;s yield would be lower.<br/><br/> <b>Credit Risk.</b> The fund is subject to the risk that a decline in the credit quality of a portfolio investment could cause the fund to lose money or underperform. The fund could lose money if the issuer of a portfolio investment fails to make timely principal or interest payments or if a guarantor or liquidity provider of a portfolio investment fails to honor its obligations. For fixed rate investments, negative perceptions of the ability of an issuer, guarantor or liquidity provider to make payments or otherwise honor its obligations, as applicable, could also cause the price of that investment to decline. The credit quality of the fund&#8217;s portfolio holdings can change rapidly in certain market environments and any downgrade or default on the part of a single portfolio investment could cause the fund&#8217;s share price or yield to fall. The fund&#8217;s investments in securities with credit or liquidity enhancements provided by foreign entities may involve certain risks that are greater than those associated with investments in securities with credit or liquidity enhancements provided by U.S. entities. These include risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions; differing accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards and practices; differing securities market structures; and higher transaction costs. In addition, sovereign risk, or the risk that a government may become unwilling or unable to meet its loan obligations or guarantees, could increase the credit risk of financial institutions connected to that particular country.<br/><br/> <b>Liquidity Support Provider Risk. </b> The fund may invest a substantial portion of its assets in securities with guarantees and/or liquidity supports provided by a bank or other financial institution, and the existence and nature of such supports may be a significant factor in the investment adviser&#8217;s decision-making process. Generally, these enhancements are employed by the issuers of the securities to reduce credit risk and provide enhanced or back-up liquidity for the purchaser, such as the fund. Adverse developments affecting these banks and financial institutions could therefore have a negative effect on the value of the fund&#8217;s holdings. For example, a rating agency downgrade of a credit or liquidity support provider may adversely affect the value of securities held by the fund. Any decline in the value of the securities held by the fund could cause the fund&#8217;s share price or yield to fall. To the extent that a portion of the fund&#8217;s underlying investments are guaranteed by the same bank or financial institution, these risks may be increased.<br/><br/> <b>Management Risk.</b> Any actively managed mutual fund is subject to the risk that its investment adviser will make poor security selections. The fund&#8217;s investment adviser applies its own investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the fund, but there can be no guarantee that they will produce the desired results. The investment adviser&#8217;s maturity decisions will also affect the fund&#8217;s yield, and in unusual circumstances potentially could affect its share price. To the extent that the investment adviser anticipates interest rate trends imprecisely, the fund&#8217;s yield at times could lag those of other money market funds.<br/><br/> <b>State Risk.</b> The fund invests primarily in securities issued by the state of New Jersey and its municipalities. Any reduction in the credit ratings of obligations of these issuers could adversely affect the market values and marketability of such securities, and, consequently, the value of the fund&#8217;s portfolio. Further, the fund&#8217;s share price and performance could be affected by local, state and regional factors, including erosion of the tax base and changes in  the economic climate. Certain New Jersey constitutional amendments, legislative measures, executive orders and administrative regulations could result in adverse consequences, affecting the state of New Jersey and/or its municipalities. National governmental actions, such as the elimination of tax-exempt status, also could affect performance. In addition, a municipality or municipal project that relies directly or indirectly on national governmental funding mechanisms may be negatively affected by the national government&#8217;s current budgetary constraints.<br/><br/> <b>Investment Concentration Risk.</b> To the extent that the fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in municipal securities financing similar projects, the fund may be more sensitive to adverse economic, business or political developments. A change that affects one project, such as proposed legislation on the financing of the project, a shortage of materials needed for the project, or a declining need for the project, would likely affect all similar projects and the overall municipal securities market.<br/><br/> <b>Taxable Determinations Risk.</b> Some of the fund&#8217;s income could be taxable. If certain types of investments the fund buys as tax-exempt are later ruled to be taxable, a portion of the fund&#8217;s income could become taxable. This risk, although generally considered low, is somewhat higher for investments that have been structured as municipal money market securities than for investments in other types of municipal money market securities. Any investments in municipal securities from issuers located in states other than New Jersey could be subject to New Jersey state tax. Any defensive investments in taxable securities or securities whose interest is subject to the AMT could generate taxable income.<br/><br/> <b>Liquidity Risk.</b> Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell. The market for certain investments may become illiquid due to specific adverse changes in the conditions of a particular issuer or under adverse market or economic conditions independent of the issuer. The fund&#8217;s investments in illiquid securities may reduce the returns of the fund because it may be unable to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. Further, transactions in illiquid securities may entail transaction costs that are higher than those for transactions in liquid securities.<br/><br/> <b>Redemption Risk.</b> The fund may experience periods of heavy redemptions that could cause the fund to liquidate its assets at inopportune times or at a loss or depressed value, particularly during periods of declining or illiquid markets. Redemptions by a few large investors in the fund may have a significant adverse effect on the fund&#8217;s ability to maintain a stable $1.00 share price. In the event any money market fund fails to maintain a stable net asset value, other money market funds, including the fund, could face a market-wide risk of increased redemption pressures, potentially jeopardizing the stability of their $1.00 share prices.<br/><br/> <b>Regulatory Risk.</b> The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulators may adopt additional money market fund regulations in the future, which may impact the operation and performance of the fund.<br/><br/> <b>Money Market Risk.</b> The fund is not designed to offer capital appreciation. In exchange for their emphasis on stability and liquidity, money market investments may offer lower long-term performance than stock or bond investments."

Strategy Narrative [Text Block],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004501_Member,,,,,"<b>To pursue its goal, the fund invests in money market securities from Massachusetts issuers and from municipal agencies, U.S. territories and possessions. </b>These securities may include general obligation issues, which typically are backed by the issuer&#8217;s ability to levy taxes; revenue bonds, which typically are backed by a stream of revenue from a given source, such as a public water system or hospital; municipal commercial paper and municipal notes; and municipal leases, which may be used to finance construction or equipment purchases. The fund may invest more than 25% of its total assets in municipal securities financing similar projects such as those relating to education, health care, transportation, utilities, industrial development and housing. Under normal circumstances, the fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets in municipal money market securities the interest from which is exempt from federal and Massachusetts personal income tax, including the federal alternative minimum tax (AMT). The fund may also invest in municipal securities of issuers located outside of Massachusetts. The fund does not currently intend to invest in any municipal securities whose interest is subject to AMT; however, this would not prevent the fund from investing in such securities as a temporary defensive measure discussed below.  <br /><br />The fund may purchase certain variable rate demand securities issued by closed-end municipal bond funds, which, in turn, invest primarily in portfolios of Massachusetts tax-exempt municipal  bonds. It is anticipated that the interest on the variable rate demand securities will be exempt from federal and Massachusetts personal income tax, including the AMT. These securities are considered &#8220;municipal money market securities&#8221; for purposes of the fund&#8217;s 80% investment policy stated above. <br /><br />Many of the fund&#8217;s securities will be subject to credit or liquidity enhancements from U.S. and/or non-U.S. entities, which are designed to provide incremental levels of creditworthiness or liquidity. Some municipal securities have been structured to resemble variable- and floating-rate securities so that they meet the requirements for being considered money market instruments.  <br /><br />In choosing securities, the fund&#8217;s manager seeks to maximize current income within the limits of the fund&#8217;s investment objective and credit, maturity and diversification policies. Some of these policies may be stricter than the federal regulations that apply to all money funds.  <br /><br />The investment adviser&#8217;s credit research department analyzes and monitors the securities that the fund owns or is considering buying. The manager may adjust the fund&#8217;s holdings or its average maturity based on actual or anticipated changes in interest rates or credit quality. To preserve its investors&#8217; capital, the fund seeks to maintain a stable $1.00 share price.  <br /><br />During unusual market conditions, the fund may invest in taxable money market securities and municipal securities whose interest is subject to the AMT as a temporary defensive measure. When the fund engages in such activities, it may not achieve its investment goal."

Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004501_Member,,,,,"The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund&#8217;s principal risks include:<br /><br /> <b>Investment Risk. </b> Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.<br /><br /> <b>Interest Rate Risk. </b> Interest rates rise and fall over time. As with any investment whose yield reflects current interest rates, the fund&#8217;s yield will change over time. During periods when interest rates are low, the fund&#8217;s yield (and total return) also will be low. In addition, to the extent the Sweep Shares make any reimbursement payments to the investment adviser and/or its affiliates, the Sweep Shares&#8217;s yield would be lower.<br /><br /> <b>Credit Risk. </b> The fund is subject to the risk that a decline in the credit quality of a portfolio investment could cause the fund to lose money or underperform. The fund could lose money if the issuer of a portfolio investment fails to make timely principal or interest payments or if a guarantor or liquidity provider of a portfolio investment fails to honor its obligations. For fixed rate investments, negative perceptions of the ability of an issuer, guarantor or liquidity provider to make payments or otherwise honor its obligations, as applicable, could also cause the price of that investment to decline. The credit quality of the fund&#8217;s portfolio holdings can change rapidly in certain market environments and any downgrade or default on the part of a single portfolio investment could cause the fund&#8217;s share price or yield to fall. The fund&#8217;s investments in securities with credit or liquidity enhancements provided by foreign entities may involve certain risks that are greater than those associated with investments in securities with credit or liquidity enhancements provided by U.S. entities. These include risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions; differing accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards and practices; differing securities market structures; and higher transaction costs. In addition, sovereign risk, or the risk that a government may become unwilling or unable to meet its loan obligations or guarantees, could increase the credit risk of financial institutions connected to that particular country.<br /><br /> <b>Liquidity Support </b> <b>Provider </b> <b>Risk. </b> The fund may invest a substantial portion of its assets in securities with guarantees and/or liquidity supports provided by a bank or other financial institution, and the existence and nature of such supports may be a significant factor in the investment adviser&#8217;s decision-making process. Generally, these enhancements are employed by the issuers of the securities to reduce credit risk and provide enhanced or back-up liquidity for the purchaser, such as the fund. Adverse developments affecting these banks and financial institutions could therefore have a negative effect on the value of the fund&#8217;s holdings. For example, a rating agency downgrade of a credit or liquidity support provider may adversely affect the value of securities held by the fund. Any decline in the value of the securities held by the fund could cause the fund&#8217;s share price or yield to fall. To the extent that a portion of the fund&#8217;s underlying investments are guaranteed by the same bank or financial institution, these risks may be increased.<br /><br /> <b>Management Risk. </b> Any actively managed mutual fund is subject to the risk that its investment adviser will make poor security selections. The fund&#8217;s investment adviser applies its own investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the fund, but there can be no guarantee that they will produce the desired results. The investment adviser&#8217;s maturity decisions will also affect the fund&#8217;s yield, and in unusual circumstances potentially could affect its share price. To the extent that the investment adviser anticipates interest rate trends imprecisely, the fund&#8217;s yield at times could lag those of other money market funds.<br /><br /> <b>State Risk. </b> The fund invests primarily in securities issued by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and its municipalities. Any reduction in the credit ratings of obligations of these issuers could adversely affect the market values and marketability of such securities, and, consequently, the value of the fund&#8217;s portfolio. Further, the fund&#8217;s share price and performance could be affected by local, state and regional factors, including erosion of the tax base and changes in the economic climate. Certain Massachusetts constitutional amendments, legislative measures, executive orders, administrative regulations and voter initiatives could result in  adverse consequences affecting Massachusetts and/or its municipalities. National governmental actions, such as the elimination of tax-exempt status, also could affect performance. In addition, a municipality or municipal project that relies directly or indirectly on national governmental funding mechanisms may be negatively affected by the national government&#8217;s current budgetary constraints.<br /><br /> <b>Investment Concentration Risk. </b> To the extent that the fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in municipal securities financing similar projects, the fund may be more sensitive to adverse economic, business or political developments. A change that affects one project, such as proposed legislation on the financing of the project, a shortage of materials needed for the project, or a declining need for the project, would likely affect all similar projects and the overall municipal securities market.<br /><br /> <b>Taxable Determinations Risk. </b> Some of the fund&#8217;s income could be taxable. If certain types of investments the fund buys as tax-exempt are later ruled to be taxable, a portion of the fund&#8217;s income could become taxable. This risk, although generally considered low, is somewhat higher for investments that have been structured as municipal money market securities than for investments in other types of municipal money market securities. Any investments in municipal securities from issuers located in states other than Massachusetts could be subject to Massachusetts state tax. Any defensive investments in taxable securities or securities whose interest is subject to the AMT could generate taxable income.<br /><br /> <b>Liquidity Risk. </b> Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell. The market for certain investments may become illiquid due to specific adverse changes in the conditions of a particular issuer or under adverse market or economic conditions independent of the issuer. The fund&#8217;s investments in illiquid securities may reduce the returns of the fund because it may be unable to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. Further, transactions in illiquid securities may entail transaction costs that are higher than those for transactions in liquid securities.<br /><br /> <b>Redemption Risk. </b> The fund may experience periods of heavy redemptions that could cause the fund to liquidate its assets at inopportune times or at a loss or depressed value, particularly during periods of declining or illiquid markets. Redemptions by a few large investors in the fund may have a significant adverse effect on the fund&#8217;s ability to maintain a stable $1.00 share price. In the event any money market fund fails to maintain a stable net asset value, other money market funds, including the fund, could face a market-wide risk of increased redemption pressures, potentially jeopardizing the stability of their $1.00 share prices.<br /><br /> <b>Regulatory Risk.</b> The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulators may adopt additional money market fund regulations in the future, which may impact the operation and performance of the fund.<br /><br /> <b>Money Market Risk. </b> The fund is not designed to offer capital appreciation. In exchange for their emphasis on stability and liquidity, money market investments may offer lower long-term performance than stock or bond investments."

Strategy [Heading],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004502_Member,,,,,<b>Principal investment strategies</b>
Strategy Narrative [Text Block],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004502_Member,,,,,"<b>To pursue its goal, the fund invests in money market securities from Pennsylvania issuers and from municipal agencies, U.S. territories and possessions.</b> These securities may include general obligation issues, which typically are backed by the issuer&#8217;s ability to levy taxes; revenue bonds, which typically are backed by a stream of revenue from a given source, such as a public water system or hospital; municipal commercial paper and municipal notes; and municipal leases, which may be used to finance construction or equipment purchases. The fund may invest more than 25% of its total assets in municipal securities financing similar projects such as those relating to education, health care, transportation, utilities, industrial development and housing. Under normal circumstances, the fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets in municipal money market securities the interest from which is exempt from federal and Pennsylvania personal income tax. The fund may also invest in municipal securities of issuers located outside Pennsylvania.<br /><br />The fund may purchase certain variable rate demand securities issued by closed-end municipal bond funds, which, in turn, invest primarily in portfolios of Pennsylvania tax-exempt municipal bonds. It is anticipated that the interest on the variable rate demand securities will be exempt from federal income tax and Pennsylvania  personal income tax. These securities are considered &#8220;municipal money market securities&#8221; for purposes of the fund&#8217;s 80% investment policy stated above.<br /><br />Many of the fund&#8217;s securities will be subject to credit or liquidity enhancements from U.S. and/or non-U.S. entities, which are designed to provide incremental levels of creditworthiness or liquidity. Some municipal securities have been structured to resemble variable- and floating-rate securities so that they meet the requirements for being considered money market instruments.<br /><br />In choosing securities, the fund&#8217;s manager seeks to maximize current income within the limits of the fund&#8217;s investment objective and credit, maturity and diversification policies. Some of these policies may be stricter than the federal regulations that apply to all money funds.<br /><br />The investment adviser&#8217;s credit research department analyzes and monitors the securities that the fund owns or is considering buying. The manager may adjust the fund&#8217;s holdings or its average maturity based on actual or anticipated changes in interest rates or credit quality. To preserve its investors&#8217; capital, the fund seeks to maintain a stable $1.00 share price.<br /><br />During unusual market conditions, the fund may invest in taxable money market securities as a temporary defensive measure. When the fund engages in such activities, it may not achieve its investment goal."
Performance Past Does Not Indicate Future [Text],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004503_Member,,,,,Keep in mind that future performance may differ from past performance.
Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_01May2012_30Apr2013S000004502_Member,,,,,"The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund&#8217;s principal risks include:<br /><br /><b>Investment Risk.</b> Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.<br /><br /><b>Interest Rate Risk.</b> Interest rates rise and fall over time. As with any investment whose yield reflects current interest rates, the fund&#8217;s yield will change over time. During periods when interest rates are low, the fund&#8217;s yield (and total return) also will be low. In addition, to the extent the Sweep Shares make any reimbursement payments to the investment adviser and/or its affiliates, the Sweep Shares&#8217;s yield would be lower.<br /><br /><b>Credit Risk.</b> The fund is subject to the risk that a decline in the credit quality of a portfolio investment could cause the fund to lose money or underperform. The fund could lose money if the issuer of a portfolio investment fails to make timely principal or interest payments or if a guarantor or liquidity provider of a portfolio investment fails to honor its obligations. For fixed rate investments, negative perceptions of the ability of an issuer, guarantor or liquidity provider to make payments or otherwise honor its obligations, as applicable, could also cause the price of that investment to decline. The credit quality of the fund&#8217;s portfolio holdings can change rapidly in certain market environments and any downgrade or default on the part of a single portfolio investment could cause the fund&#8217;s share price or yield to fall. The fund&#8217;s investments in securities with credit or liquidity enhancements provided by foreign entities may involve certain risks that are greater than those associated with investments in securities with credit or liquidity enhancements provided by U.S. entities. These include risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions; differing accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards and practices; differing securities market structures; and higher transaction costs. In addition, sovereign risk, or the risk that a government may become unwilling or unable to meet its loan obligations or guarantees, could increase the credit risk of financial institutions connected to that particular country.<br /><br /><b>Liquidity Support Provider Risk.</b> The fund may invest a substantial portion of its assets in securities with guarantees and/or liquidity supports provided by a bank or other financial institution, and the existence and nature of such supports may be a significant factor in the investment adviser&#8217;s decision-making process. Generally, these enhancements are employed by the issuers of the securities to reduce credit risk and provide enhanced or back-up liquidity for the purchaser, such as the fund. Adverse developments affecting these banks and financial institutions could therefore have a negative effect on the value of the fund&#8217;s holdings. For example, a rating agency downgrade of a credit or liquidity support provider may adversely affect the value of securities held by the fund. Any decline in the value of the securities held by the fund could cause the fund&#8217;s share price or yield to fall. To the extent that a portion of the fund&#8217;s underlying investments are guaranteed by the same bank or financial institution, these risks may be increased.<br /><br /><b>Management Risk.</b> Any actively managed mutual fund is subject to the risk that its investment adviser will make poor security selections. The fund&#8217;s investment adviser applies its own investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the fund, but there can be no guarantee that they will produce the desired results. The investment adviser&#8217;s maturity decisions will also affect the fund&#8217;s yield, and in unusual circumstances potentially could affect its share price. To the extent that the investment adviser anticipates interest rate trends imprecisely, the fund&#8217;s yield at times could lag those of other money market funds.<br /><br /><b>State Risk.</b> The fund invests primarily in securities issued by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and its municipalities. Any reduction in the credit ratings of obligations of these issuers could adversely affect the market values and marketability of such securities, and, consequently, the value of the fund&#8217;s portfolio. Further, the fund&#8217;s share price and performance could be affected by local, state and regional factors, including erosion of the tax base and changes in the economic climate. Certain Pennsylvania constitutional amendments, legislative measures, executive orders and administrative regulations could result in adverse consequences, affecting the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and/or  its municipalities. National governmental actions, such as the elimination of tax-exempt status, also could affect performance. In addition, a municipality or municipal project that relies directly or indirectly on national governmental funding mechanisms may be negatively affected by the national government&#8217;s current budgetary constraints.<br /><br /><b>Investment Concentration Risk.</b> To the extent that the fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in municipal securities financing similar projects, the fund may be more sensitive to adverse economic, business or political developments. A change that affects one project, such as proposed legislation on the financing of the project, a shortage of materials needed for the project, or a declining need for the project, would likely affect all similar projects and the overall municipal securities market.<br /><br /><b>Taxable Determinations Risk.</b> Some of the fund&#8217;s income could be taxable. If certain types of investments the fund buys as tax-exempt are later ruled to be taxable, a portion of the fund&#8217;s income could become taxable. This risk, although generally considered low, is somewhat higher for investments that have been structured as municipal money market securities than for investments in other types of municipal money market securities. Any investments in municipal securities from issuers located in states other than Pennsylvania could be subject to Pennsylvania state tax. Any defensive investments in taxable securities could generate taxable income. Also, some types of municipal securities produce income that is subject to the federal alternative minimum tax (AMT).<br /><br /><b>Liquidity Risk.</b> Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell. The market for certain investments may become illiquid due to specific adverse changes in the conditions of a particular issuer or under adverse market or economic conditions independent of the issuer. The fund&#8217;s investments in illiquid securities may reduce the returns of the fund because it may be unable to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. Further, transactions in illiquid securities may entail transaction costs that are higher than those for transactions in liquid securities.<br /><br /><b>Redemption Risk.</b> The fund may experience periods of heavy redemptions that could cause the fund to liquidate its assets at inopportune times or at a loss or depressed value, particularly during periods of declining or illiquid markets. Redemptions by a few large investors in the fund may have a significant adverse effect on the fund&#8217;s ability to maintain a stable $1.00 share price. In the event any money market fund fails to maintain a stable net asset value, other money market funds, including the fund, could face a market-wide risk of increased redemption pressures, potentially jeopardizing the stability of their $1.00 share prices.<br /><br /><b>Regulatory Risk.</b> The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulators may adopt additional money market fund regulations in the future, which may impact the operation and performance of the fund.<br /><br /><b>Money Market Risk.</b> The fund is not designed to offer capital appreciation. In exchange for their emphasis on stability and liquidity, money market investments may offer lower long-term performance than stock or bond investments."
