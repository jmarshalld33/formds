These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the Fund&#8217;s performance.

Strategy Narrative [Text Block],Duration_29Feb2012_28Feb2013S000002250_Member,,,,,"Under normal conditions, Emerging Markets Fund invests at least 80% of its total assets in equity securities of issuers located in countries with developing capital markets. Equity securities consist primarily of common and preferred stocks and depositary receipts, and include securities convertible into common stock, and securities or other instruments whose price is linked to the value of common stock. A developing capital market is the market of any country that the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation, the United Nations or its authorities have determined to have a low or middle income economy. Countries with developing capital markets can be found in regions such as Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe and Africa. For this purpose, developing capital markets include, but are not limited to, the markets of all countries that comprise the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. The Fund may also consider an issuer to be located in a country that has a developing capital market if at least 50% of the issuer&#8217;s assets, gross revenues or profits in any one of the last two years represents assets or activities located in such countries.<br/><br/>The Fund may also invest in fixed income securities issued by companies and governments in these countries, as well as mezzanine investments. The Fund normally invests in at least three countries at any given time. The Fund can invest in securities denominated in either U.S. dollars or foreign currencies. Fund management anticipates that under most circumstances the Fund&#8217;s investments will primarily be denominated in foreign currencies. The Fund has not established any rating or maturity criteria for the debt securities in which it may invest. From time to time the Fund may invest in shares of companies through initial public offerings.<br/><br/>Fund management may, when consistent with the Fund&#8217;s investment objective, buy or sell options or futures on a security or an index of securities, or enter into interest rate or foreign currency transactions, including swaps (collectively, commonly known as derivatives). The Fund&#8217;s exposure to certain markets may be effected through investments in participation notes or other structured or derivative instruments that are designed to replicate, or otherwise provide exposure to, the performance of securities listed in such markets.<br/><br/>The Fund is classified as non-diversified under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, which means that it can invest more of its assets in fewer companies than a diversified fund."

Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_29Feb2012_28Feb2013S000002250_Member,,,,,"Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in Emerging Markets Fund, as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment, may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. The following is a summary description of certain risks of investing in the Fund. <ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><p style=""PADDING-LEFT: 15px""><b> Convertible Securities Risk &#8212; </b>The market value of a convertible security performs like that of a regular debt security; that is, if market interest rates rise, the value of a convertible security usually falls. In addition, convertible securities are subject to the risk that the issuer will not be able to pay interest or dividends when due, and their market value may change based on changes in the issuer's credit rating or the market's perception of the issuer's creditworthiness. Since it derives a portion of its value from the common stock into which it may be converted, a convertible security is also subject to the same types of market and issuer risks that apply to the underlying common stock.</p></li><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><p style=""PADDING-LEFT: 15px""><b> Depositary Receipts Risk &#8212;</b> The issuers of unsponsored depositary receipts are not obligated to disclose information that is, in the United States, considered material. Therefore, there may be less information available regarding these issuers and there may not be a correlation between such information and the market value of the depositary receipts. Depositary receipts are generally subject to the same risks as the foreign securities that they evidence or into which they may be converted.</p></li><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><p style=""PADDING-LEFT: 15px""><b> Derivatives Risk &#8212;</b> The Fund's use of derivatives may reduce the Fund's returns and/or increase volatility. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, an index or a market to fluctuate significantly in price within a short time period. Derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party to the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund's use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the overall securities markets. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund to value accurately. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Recent legislation calls for new regulation of the derivatives markets. The extent and impact of the regulation is not yet known and may not be known for some time. New regulation may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, or may otherwise adversely affect the value or performance of derivatives. <br/><br/>Risks of Investing in Participation Notes &#8212; Investing in participation notes involves the same risks associated with a direct investment in the shares of the companies the notes seek to replicate. However, the performance results of participation notes will not replicate exactly the performance of the issuers or markets that the notes seek to replicate due to transaction costs and other expenses. In addition, the participation notes are subject to counterparty risk. Participation notes may be considered illiquid.</p></li><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><p style=""PADDING-LEFT: 15px""><b>Emerging Markets Risk</b> &#8212; Emerging markets are riskier than more developed markets because they tend to develop unevenly and may never fully develop. Investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative.<br/> Emerging markets are more likely to experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations, which adversely affect returns to U.S. investors. In addition, many emerging securities markets have far lower trading volumes and less liquidity than developed markets.</p></li><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><p style=""PADDING-LEFT: 15px""><b>Equity Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Stock markets are volatile. The price of equity securities fluctuates based on changes in a company&#8217;s financial condition and overall market and economic conditions.</p></li><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><p style=""PADDING-LEFT: 15px""><b>Foreign Securities Risk &#8212; </b>Foreign investments often involve special risks not present in U.S. investments that can increase the chances that the Fund will lose money. These risks include:</p></li></ul><div><table style=""border-collapse: collapse;"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%""> <tr><td width=""1.7%""> </td> <td valign=""top"" width=""2.5%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left""> <p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"">The Fund generally holds its foreign securities and cash in foreign banks and securities depositories, which may be recently organized or new to the foreign custody business and may be subject to only limited or no regulatory oversight. </p></td></tr></table></div><br/><div><table style=""border-collapse: collapse;"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%""> <tr><td width=""1.7%""> </td> <td valign=""top"" width=""2.5%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left""> <p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"">Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the value of the Fund&#8217;s portfolio. </p></td></tr></table></div><br/><div><table style=""border-collapse: collapse;"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%""> <tr><td width=""1.7%""> </td> <td valign=""top"" width=""2.5%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left""> <p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"">The economies of certain foreign markets may not compare favorably with the economy of the United States with respect to such issues as growth of gross national product, reinvestment of capital, resources and balance of payments position. </p></td></tr></table></div><br/><div><table style=""border-collapse: collapse;"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%""> <tr><td width=""1.7%""> </td> <td valign=""top"" width=""2.5%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left""> <p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"">The governments of certain countries may prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on foreign investments in their capital markets or in certain industries. </p></td></tr></table></div><br/><div><table style=""border-collapse: collapse;"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%""> <tr><td width=""1.7%""> </td> <td valign=""top"" width=""2.5%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left""> <p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"">Many foreign governments do not supervise and regulate stock exchanges, brokers and the sale of securities to the same extent as does the United States and may not have laws to protect investors that are comparable to U.S. securities laws. </p></td></tr></table></div><br/><div><table style=""border-collapse: collapse;"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%""> <tr><td width=""1.7%""> </td> <td valign=""top"" width=""2.5%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left""> <p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"">Settlement and clearance procedures in certain foreign markets may result in delays in payment for or delivery of securities not typically associated with settlement and clearance of U.S. investments. </p></td></tr></table></div><br/><div><table style=""border-collapse: collapse;"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%""> <tr><td width=""1.7%""> </td> <td valign=""top"" width=""2.5%"" align=""left"">&#8212;</td> <td valign=""top"" align=""left""> <p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"">The European financial markets have recently experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns in, or rising government debt levels of several European countries.

These transactions may include, among others, derivatives, and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. The use of leverage may cause the Fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations or to meet any required asset segregation requirements. Increases and decreases in the value of the Fund's portfolio will be magnified when the Fund uses leverage.</p></li><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><p style=""PADDING-LEFT: 15px""><b> Market Risk and Selection Risk &#8212;</b> Market risk is the risk that one or more markets in which the Fund invests will go down in value, including the possibility that the markets will go down sharply and unpredictably. Selection risk is the risk that the securities selected by Fund management will underperform the markets, the relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds with similar investment objectives and investment strategies. This means you may lose money.</p></li><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><p style=""PADDING-LEFT: 15px""><b> ""New Issues"" Risk &#8212;</b> ""New Issues"" are initial public offerings (""IPOs"") of equity securities of U.S. or non-U.S. issuers.
