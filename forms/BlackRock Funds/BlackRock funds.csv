Strategy Narrative [Text Block],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000001511_MemberInvestorAndInstitutional_Member,,,,,"Under normal market conditions, International Opportunities invests at least 80% of its net assets in equity securities issued by foreign companies of any market capitalization. The Fund may invest up to 40% of its net assets in stocks of issuers in emerging market countries.<br/><br/>The Fund seeks to buy primarily common stock but can also invest in preferred stock and convertible securities. From time to time the Fund may invest in shares of companies through initial public offerings (&#8220;IPOs&#8221;).<br/><br/>The Fund may, when consistent with the Fund&#8217;s investment objective, buy or sell options or futures on a security or an index of securities and may buy options on a currency or a basket of currencies, or enter into foreign currency transactions, including swaps (collectively, commonly known as derivatives). The Fund typically uses derivatives as a substitute for taking a position in the underlying asset and/or as part of a strategy designed to reduce exposure to other risks, such as currency risk. The Fund may also use derivatives to enhance returns, in which case their use would involve leveraging risk. The Fund may seek to obtain market exposure to the securities in which it primarily invests by entering into a series of purchase and sale contracts or by using other investment techniques (such as reverse repurchase agreements or dollar rolls). The Fund may also use forward foreign currency exchange contracts (obligations to buy or sell a currency at a set rate in the future)."

Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000001511_MemberInvestorAndInstitutional_Member,,,,,"Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in International Opportunities, as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment, may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. The following is a summary description of principal risks of investing in the Fund.<ul type=""square""><li><b>Convertible Securities Risk</b> &#8212; The market value of a convertible security performs like that of a regular debt security; that is, if market interest rates rise, the value of a convertible security usually falls. In addition, convertible securities are subject to the risk that the issuer will not be able to pay interest or dividends when due, and their market value may change based on changes in the issuer&#8217;s credit rating or the market&#8217;s perception of the issuer&#8217;s creditworthiness. Since it derives a portion of its value from the common stock into which it may be converted, a convertible security is also subject to the same types of market and issuer risks that apply to the underlying common stock.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Derivatives Risk</b> &#8212; The Fund&#8217;s use of derivatives may reduce the Fund&#8217;s returns and/or increase volatility. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, an index or a market to fluctuate significantly in price within a short time period. Derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund&#8217;s use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the overall securities markets. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund to value accurately. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Recent legislation calls for new regulation of the derivatives markets. The extent and impact of the regulation is not yet known and may not be known for some time. New regulation may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, or may otherwise adversely affect the value or performance of derivatives.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Emerging Markets Risk</b> &#8212; Emerging markets are riskier than more developed markets because they tend to develop unevenly and may never fully develop. Investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative. Emerging markets are more likely to experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations, which adversely affect returns to U.S. investors. In addition, many emerging securities markets have far lower trading volumes and less liquidity than developed markets.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Equity Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Stock markets are volatile. The price of equity securities fluctuates based on changes in a company&#8217;s financial condition and overall market and economic conditions.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Foreign Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Foreign investments often involve special risks not present in U.S. investments that can increase the chances that the Fund will lose money. These risks include:<br/><br/>&#8212; The Fund generally holds its foreign securities and cash in foreign banks and securities depositories, which may be recently organized or new to the foreign custody business and may be subject to only limited or no regulatory oversight.<br/><br/>&#8212; Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the value of the Fund&#8217;s portfolio.<br/><br/>&#8212; The economies of certain foreign markets may not compare favorably with the economy of the United States with respect to such issues as growth of gross national product, reinvestment of capital, resources and balance of payments position.<br/><br/>&#8212; The governments of certain countries may prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on foreign investments in their capital markets or in certain industries.<br/><br/>&#8212; Many foreign governments do not supervise and regulate stock exchanges, brokers and the sale of securities to the same extent as does the United States and may not have laws to protect investors that are comparable to U.S. securities laws.<br/><br/>&#8212; Settlement and clearance procedures in certain foreign markets may result in delays in payment for or delivery of securities not typically associated with settlement and clearance of U.S. investments.<br/><br/>&#8212; The European financial markets have recently experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns in, or rising government debt levels of several European countries. These events have adversely affected the exchange rate of the Euro and may spread to other countries in Europe, including countries that do not use the Euro. These events may affect the value and liquidity of certain of the Fund&#8217;s investments.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Investment Style Risk</b> &#8212; Under certain market conditions, growth investments have performed better during the later stages of economic expansion. Therefore, this investment style may over time go in and out of favor. At times when the investment style used by the Fund is out of favor, the Fund may underperform other equity funds that use different investment styles.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Leverage Risk</b> &#8212; Some transactions may give rise to a form of economic leverage. These transactions may include, among others, derivatives, and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. The use of leverage may cause the Fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations or to meet any required asset segregation requirements. Increases and decreases in the value of the Fund&#8217;s portfolio will be magnified when the Fund uses leverage. </li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Market Risk and Selection Risk</b> &#8212; Market risk is the risk that one or more markets in which the Fund invests will go down in value, including the possibility that the markets will go down sharply and unpredictably. Selection risk is the risk that the securities selected by Fund management will underperform the markets, the relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds with similar investment objectives and investment strategies. This means you may lose money.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Mid-Cap Securities Risk</b> &#8212; The securities of mid-cap companies generally trade in lower volumes and are generally subject to greater and less predictable price changes than the securities of larger capitalization companies.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>&#8220;New Issues&#8221; Risk</b> &#8212; &#8220;New Issues&#8221; are initial public offerings of equity securities of U.S. and non-U.S. issuers. Securities issued in IPOs have no trading history, and information about the companies may be available for very limited periods. In addition, the prices of securities sold in IPOs may be highly volatile or may decline shortly after the initial public offering.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Small Cap Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Small cap companies may have limited product lines or markets. They may be less financially secure than larger, more established companies. They may depend on a more limited management group than larger capitalized companies.</li></ul>"

The Fund seeks to buy primarily common stock but may also invest in preferred stock and convertible securities. The Fund may invest up to 25% of its total assets in stocks of issuers in emerging market countries.<br/><br/>The Fund may invest up to 25% of its total assets in global fixed income securities, including corporate bonds, U.S. government debt securities, non-U.S. government and supranational debt securities, asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, emerging market debt securities and non-investment grade debt securities (high yield or junk bonds). Investment in fixed income securities will be made on an opportunistic basis. Securities will be identified based on factors such as relative value and earnings estimate revisions.<br/><br/>From time to time, the Fund may invest in shares of companies through initial public offerings (&#8220;IPOs&#8221;). The Fund will invest in securities of non-U.S. issuers that can be U.S. dollar based or non-U.S. dollar based on a hedged or unhedged basis. The Fund may enter into currency transactions on a hedged or unhedged basis in order to seek total return.<br/><br/>The Fund may, when consistent with the Fund&#8217;s investment objective, buy or sell options or futures on a security or an index of securities and may buy options on a currency or a basket of currencies, or enter into foreign currency transactions, including swaps (collectively, commonly known as derivatives). The Fund typically uses derivatives as a substitute for taking a position in the underlying asset and/or as part of a strategy designed to reduce exposure to other risks, such as currency risk. The Fund may also use derivatives to enhance returns, in which case their use would involve leveraging risk. The Fund may seek to obtain market exposure to the securities in which it primarily invests by entering into a series of purchase and sale contracts or by using other investment techniques (such as reverse repurchase agreements or dollar rolls). The Fund may also use forward foreign currency exchange contracts (obligations to buy or sell a currency at a set rate in the future)."

The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund&#8217;s operating expenses remain the same.

Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000001509_MemberInvestorAndInstitutional_Member,,,,,"Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in U.S. Opportunities, as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment, may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. The following is a summary description of principal risks of investing in the Fund.<ul type=""square""><li><b>Convertible Securities Risk</b> &#8212; The market value of a convertible security performs like that of a regular debt security; that is, if market interest rates rise, the value of a convertible security usually falls. In addition, convertible securities are subject to the risk that the issuer will not be able to pay interest or dividends when due, and their market value may change based on changes in the issuer&#8217;s credit rating or the market&#8217;s perception of the issuer&#8217;s creditworthiness. Since it derives a portion of its value from the common stock into which it may be converted, a convertible security is also subject to the same types of market and issuer risks that apply to the underlying common stock.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Derivatives Risk</b> &#8212; The Fund&#8217;s use of derivatives may reduce the Fund&#8217;s returns and/or increase volatility. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, an index or a market to fluctuate significantly in price within a short time period. Derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund&#8217;s use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the overall securities markets. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund to value accurately. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Recent legislation calls for new regulation of the derivatives markets. The extent and impact of the regulation is not yet known and may not be known for some time. New regulation may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, or may otherwise adversely affect the value or performance of derivatives.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Equity Securities Risk </b>&#8212; Stock markets are volatile. The price of equity securities fluctuates based on changes in a company&#8217;s financial condition and overall market and economic conditions.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Investment Style Risk </b>&#8212; Under certain market conditions, growth investments have performed better during the later stages of economic expansion. Therefore, this investment style may over time go in and out of favor. At times when the investment style used by the Fund is out of favor, the Fund may underperform other equity funds that use different investment styles.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Leverage Risk </b>&#8212; Some transactions may give rise to a form of economic leverage. These transactions may include, among others, derivatives, and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. The use of leverage may cause the Fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations or to meet any required asset segregation requirements. Increases and decreases in the value of the Fund&#8217;s portfolio will be magnified when the Fund uses leverage.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Market Risk and Selection Risk </b>&#8212; Market risk is the risk that one or more markets in which the Fund invests will go down in value, including the possibility that the markets will go down sharply and unpredictably. Selection risk is the risk that the securities selected by Fund management will underperform the markets, the relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds with similar investment objectives and investment strategies. This means you may lose money.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Mid-Cap Securities Risk </b>&#8212; The securities of mid-cap companies generally trade in lower volumes and are generally subject to greater and less predictable price changes than the securities of larger capitalization companies.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>&#8220;New Issues&#8221; Risk </b>&#8212; &#8220;New Issues&#8221; are initial public offerings of equity securities of U.S. and non-U.S. issuers. Securities issued in IPOs have no trading history, and information about the companies may be available for very limited periods. In addition, the prices of securities sold in IPOs may be highly volatile or may decline shortly after the initial public offering.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Small Cap and Emerging Growth Securities Risk </b>&#8212; Small cap or emerging growth companies may have limited product lines or markets. They may be less financially secure than larger, more established companies. They may depend on a more limited management group than larger capitalized companies.</li></ul>"

Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000008399_MemberInvestorInstitutionalAndRShares_Member,,,,,"Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in Global Opportunities, as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment, may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. The following is a summary description of principal risks of investing in the Fund.<ul type=""square""><li><b>Convertible Securities Risk</b> &#8212; The market value of a convertible security performs like that of a regular debt security; that is, if market interest rates rise, the value of a convertible security usually falls. In addition, convertible securities are subject to the risk that the issuer will not be able to pay interest or dividends when due, and their market value may change based on changes in the issuer&#8217;s credit rating or the market&#8217;s perception of the issuer&#8217;s creditworthiness. Since it derives a portion of its value from the common stock into which it may be converted, a convertible security is also subject to the same types of market and issuer risks that apply to the underlying common stock.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Debt Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Debt securities, such as bonds, involve credit risk. Credit risk is the risk that the borrower will not make timely payments of principal and interest. Changes in an issuer&#8217;s credit rating or the market&#8217;s perception of an issuer&#8217;s creditworthiness may also affect the value of the Fund&#8217;s investment in that issuer. The degree of credit risk depends on the issuer&#8217;s financial condition and on the terms of the securities. Debt securities are also subject to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a debt security may fall when interest rates rise. In general, the market price of debt securities with longer maturities will go up or down more in response to changes in interest rates than the market price of shorter term securities.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Derivatives Risk</b> &#8212; The Fund&#8217;s use of derivatives may reduce the Fund&#8217;s returns and/or increase volatility. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, an index or a market to fluctuate significantly in price within a short time period. Derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund&#8217;s use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the overall securities markets. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund to value accurately. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Recent legislation calls for new regulation of the derivatives markets. The extent and impact of the regulation is not yet known and may not be known for some time. New regulation may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, or may otherwise adversely affect the value or performance of derivatives.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Emerging Markets Risk</b> &#8212; Emerging markets are riskier than more developed markets because they tend to develop unevenly and may never fully develop. Investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative. Emerging markets are more likely to experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations, which adversely affect returns to U.S. investors. In addition, many emerging securities markets have far lower trading volumes and less liquidity than developed markets.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Equity Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Stock markets are volatile. The price of equity securities fluctuates based on changes in a company&#8217;s financial condition and overall market and economic conditions.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Foreign Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Foreign investments often involve special risks not present in U.S. investments that can increase the chances that the Fund will lose money. These risks include:<br/><br/>&#8212; The Fund generally holds its foreign securities and cash in foreign banks and securities depositories, which may be recently organized or new to the foreign custody business and may be subject to only limited or no regulatory oversight.<br/><br/>&#8212; Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the value of the Fund&#8217;s portfolio.<br/><br/>&#8212; The economies of certain foreign markets may not compare favorably with the economy of the United States with respect to such issues as growth of gross national product, reinvestment of capital, resources and balance of payments position.<br/><br/>&#8212; The governments of certain countries may prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on foreign investments in their capital markets or in certain industries.<br/><br/>&#8212; Many foreign governments do not supervise and regulate stock exchanges, brokers and the sale of securities to the same extent as does the United States and may not have laws to protect investors that are comparable to U.S. securities laws.<br/><br/>&#8212; Settlement and clearance procedures in certain foreign markets may result in delays in payment for or delivery of securities not typically associated with settlement and clearance of U.S. investments.<br/><br/>&#8212; The European financial markets have recently experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns in, or rising government debt levels of several European countries. These events have adversely affected the exchange rate of the Euro and may spread to other countries in Europe, including countries that do not use the Euro. These events may affect the value and liquidity of certain of the Fund&#8217;s investments.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Investment Style Risk</b> &#8212; Under certain market conditions, growth investments have performed better during the later stages of economic expansion. Therefore, this investment style may over time go in and out of favor. At times when the investment style used by the Fund is out of favor, the Fund may underperform other equity funds that use different investment styles.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Leverage Risk</b> &#8212; Some transactions may give rise to a form of economic leverage. These transactions may include, among others, derivatives, and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. The use of leverage may cause the Fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations or to meet any required asset segregation requirements. Increases and decreases in the value of the Fund&#8217;s portfolio will be magnified when the Fund uses leverage.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Market Risk and Selection Risk</b> &#8212; Market risk is the risk that one or more markets in which the Fund invests will go down in value, including the possibility that the markets will go down sharply and unpredictably. Selection risk is the risk that the securities selected by Fund management will underperform the markets, the relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds with similar investment objectives and investment strategies. This means you may lose money.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Mid-Cap Securities Risk</b> &#8212; The securities of mid-cap companies generally trade in lower volumes and are generally subject to greater and less predictable price changes than the securities of larger capitalization companies.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>&#8220;New Issues&#8221; Risk</b> &#8212; &#8220;New Issues&#8221; are initial public offerings of equity securities of U.S. and non-U.S. issuers. Securities issued in IPOs have no trading history, and information about the companies may be available for very limited periods. In addition, the prices of securities sold in IPOs may be highly volatile or may decline shortly after the initial public offering.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Small Cap Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Small cap companies may have limited product lines or markets. They may be less financially secure than larger, more established companies. They may depend on a more limited management group than larger capitalized companies.</li></ul>"

Performance Narrative [Text Block],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000001877_MemberInvestorInstitutionalAndRShares_Member,,,,,"On January 31, 2005, Health Sciences Opportunities reorganized with the State Street Research Health Sciences Fund (the &#8220;SSR Fund&#8221;). For periods prior to January 31, 2005, the chart and table show performance information for the SSR Fund, which had investment objectives and strategies substantially similar to the Fund. The performance of Investor B and Investor C Shares for the period before they were launched is based on the performance of Investor A Shares, adjusted to reflect the class specific fees applicable to Investor B and Investor C Shares, respectively, at the time of such share class&#8217; launch. Class R Shares commenced operations on September 12, 2011, therefore the returns in the table for Class R Shares prior to commencement date are based on the Fund&#8217;s Institutional Shares, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses applicable to Class R Shares. This information may be considered when assessing the Fund&#8217;s performance, but does not represent the actual performance of these share classes.<br/><br/>The information shows you how the Fund&#8217;s performance has varied year by year and provides some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund. The table compares the Fund&#8217;s performance to that of the Standard & Poor&#8217;s (&#8220;S&P&#8221;) 500<sup>&#174; </sup>Index. The table also compares the Fund&#8217;s performance to that of the Russell 3000<sup>&#174;</sup> Health Care Index, which is relevant to the Fund because it has characteristics similar to the Fund&#8217;s investment strategies. As with all such investments, past performance (before and after taxes) is not an indication of future results. Sales charges are not reflected in the bar chart. If they were, returns would be less than those shown. However, the table includes all applicable fees and sales charges. If BlackRock and its affiliates had not waived or reimbursed certain Fund expenses during these periods, the Fund&#8217;s returns would have been lower. Updated information on the Fund&#8217;s results can be obtained by visiting http://www.blackrock.com/funds or can be obtained by phone at (800) 882-0052."

Strategy Narrative [Text Block],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000001511_MemberServiceShares_Member,,,,,"Under normal market conditions, International Opportunities invests at least 80% of its net assets in equity securities issued by foreign companies of any market capitalization. The Fund may invest up to 40% of its net assets in stocks of issuers in emerging market countries.<br/><br/>The Fund seeks to buy primarily common stock but can also invest in preferred stock and convertible securities. From time to time the Fund may invest in shares of companies through initial public offerings (&#8220;IPOs&#8221;).<br/><br/>The Fund may, when consistent with the Fund&#8217;s investment objective, buy or sell options or futures on a security or an index of securities and may buy options on a currency or a basket of currencies, or enter into foreign currency transactions, including swaps (collectively, commonly known as derivatives). The Fund typically uses derivatives as a substitute for taking a position in the underlying asset and/or as part of a strategy designed to reduce exposure to other risks, such as currency risk. The Fund may also use derivatives to enhance returns, in which case their use would involve leveraging risk. The Fund may seek to obtain market exposure to the securities in which it primarily invests by entering into a series of purchase and sale contracts or by using other investment techniques (such as reverse repurchase agreements or dollar rolls). The Fund may also use forward foreign currency exchange contracts (obligations to buy or sell a currency at a set rate in the future)."

Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000001511_MemberServiceShares_Member,,,,,"Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in International Opportunities, as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment, may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. The following is a summary description of principal risks of investing in the Fund.<ul type=""square""><li><b>Convertible Securities Risk</b> &#8212; The market value of a convertible security performs like that of a regular debt security; that is, if market interest rates rise, the value of a convertible security usually falls. In addition, convertible securities are subject to the risk that the issuer will not be able to pay interest or dividends when due, and their market value may change based on changes in the issuer&#8217;s credit rating or the market&#8217;s perception of the issuer&#8217;s creditworthiness. Since it derives a portion of its value from the common stock into which it may be converted, a convertible security is also subject to the same types of market and issuer risks that apply to the underlying common stock.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Derivatives Risk</b> &#8212; The Fund&#8217;s use of derivatives may reduce the Fund&#8217;s returns and/or increase volatility. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, an index or a market to fluctuate significantly in price within a short time period. Derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund&#8217;s use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the overall securities markets. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund to value accurately. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Recent legislation calls for new regulation of the derivatives markets. The extent and impact of the regulation is not yet known and may not be known for some time. New regulation may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, or may otherwise adversely affect the value or performance of derivatives.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Emerging Markets Risk</b> &#8212; Emerging markets are riskier than more developed markets because they tend to develop unevenly and may never fully develop. Investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative. Emerging markets are more likely to experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations, which adversely affect returns to U.S. investors. In addition, many emerging securities markets have far lower trading volumes and less liquidity than developed markets.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Equity Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Stock markets are volatile. The price of equity securities fluctuates based on changes in a company&#8217;s financial condition and overall market and economic conditions.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Foreign Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Foreign investments often involve special risks not present in U.S. investments that can increase the chances that the Fund will lose money. These risks include:<br/><br/>&#8212; The Fund generally holds its foreign securities and cash in foreign banks and securities depositories, which may be recently organized or new to the foreign custody business and may be subject to only limited or no regulatory oversight.<br/><br/>&#8212; Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the value of the Fund&#8217;s portfolio.<br/><br/>&#8212; The economies of certain foreign markets may not compare favorably with the economy of the United States with respect to such issues as growth of gross national product, reinvestment of capital, resources and balance of payments position.<br/><br/>&#8212; The governments of certain countries may prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on foreign investments in their capital markets or in certain industries.<br/><br/>&#8212; Many foreign governments do not supervise and regulate stock exchanges, brokers and the sale of securities to the same extent as does the United States and may not have laws to protect investors that are comparable to U.S. securities laws.<br/><br/>&#8212; Settlement and clearance procedures in certain foreign markets may result in delays in payment for or delivery of securities not typically associated with settlement and clearance of U.S. investments.<br/><br/>&#8212; The European financial markets have recently experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns in, or rising government debt levels of several European countries. These events have adversely affected the exchange rate of the Euro and may spread to other countries in Europe, including countries that do not use the Euro. These events may affect the value and liquidity of certain of the Fund&#8217;s investments.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Investment Style Risk</b> &#8212; Under certain market conditions, growth investments have performed better during the later stages of economic expansion. Therefore, this investment style may over time go in and out of favor. At times when the investment style used by the Fund is out of favor, the Fund may underperform other equity funds that use different investment styles.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Leverage Risk</b> &#8212; Some transactions may give rise to a form of economic leverage. These transactions may include, among others, derivatives, and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. The use of leverage may cause the Fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations or to meet any required asset segregation requirements. Increases and decreases in the value of the Fund&#8217;s portfolio will be magnified when the Fund uses leverage. </li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Market Risk and Selection Risk</b> &#8212; Market risk is the risk that one or more markets in which the Fund invests will go down in value, including the possibility that the markets will go down sharply and unpredictably. Selection risk is the risk that the securities selected by Fund management will underperform the markets, the relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds with similar investment objectives and investment strategies. This means you may lose money.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Mid-Cap Securities Risk</b> &#8212; The securities of mid-cap companies generally trade in lower volumes and are generally subject to greater and less predictable price changes than the securities of larger capitalization companies.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>&#8220;New Issues&#8221; Risk</b> &#8212; &#8220;New Issues&#8221; are initial public offerings of equity securities of U.S. and non-U.S. issuers. Securities issued in IPOs have no trading history, and information about the companies may be available for very limited periods. In addition, the prices of securities sold in IPOs may be highly volatile or may decline shortly after the initial public offering.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Small Cap Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Small cap companies may have limited product lines or markets.

In the future, the Fund may define emerging capitalization companies using a different index or classification system.<br/><br/>The Fund seeks to buy primarily common stock but can also invest in preferred stock and convertible securities.

The primary purpose of using derivatives is to attempt to reduce risk to the Fund as a whole (hedge), but they may also be used to maintain liquidity and commit cash pending investment.

If they were, returns would be less than those shown. However, the table includes all applicable fees and sales charges. If BlackRock and its affiliates had not waived or reimbursed certain Fund expenses during these periods, the Fund&#8217;s returns would have been lower.

Strategy Narrative [Text Block],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000001510_MemberServiceShares_Member,,,,,"Under normal market conditions, Science & Technology Opportunities invests at least 80% of its net assets in equity securities issued by U.S. and non-U.S. science and technology companies in all market capitalization ranges, selected for their rapid and sustainable growth potential from the development, advancement and use of science and/or use of technology. The Fund may invest up to 25% of its net assets in emerging market countries.<br/><br/> Some of the industries likely to be represented in the Fund&#8217;s portfolio holdings include: application software, IT consulting and services, internet software and services, networking equipment, telecom equipment, computer hardware, computer storage and peripherals, electronic equipment and instruments, semiconductors and equipment, aerospace and defense, electrical components and equipment, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, healthcare equipment and supplies, healthcare distribution and services, healthcare facilities, industrial gases, specialty chemicals, advanced materials, internet and catalog retail, integrated telecom services, alternative carriers and wireless telecommunication services.<br/><br/>The Fund seeks to invest primarily in common stock but may also invest in preferred stock and convertible securities. The Fund may also invest in Rule 144A securities, which are privately placed securities purchased by qualified institutional buyers. From time to time the Fund may invest in shares of companies through initial public offerings (&#8220;IPOs&#8221;).<br/><br/>The Fund may, when consistent with the Fund&#8217;s investment objective, buy or sell options or futures on a security or an index of securities and may buy options on a currency or a basket of currencies, or enter into foreign currency transactions, including swaps (collectively, commonly known as derivatives). The Fund typically uses derivatives as a substitute for taking a position in the underlying asset and/or as part of a strategy designed to reduce exposure to other risks, such as currency risk. The Fund may also use derivatives to enhance returns, in which case their use would involve leveraging risk. The Fund may seek to obtain market exposure to the securities in which it primarily invests by entering into a series of purchase and sale contracts or by using other investment techniques (such as reverse repurchase agreements or dollar rolls). The Fund may also use forward foreign currency exchange contracts (obligations to buy or sell a currency at a set rate in the future)."

Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000001510_MemberServiceShares_Member,,,,,"Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in Science & Technology Opportunities, as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment, may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. The following is a summary description of principal risks of investing in the Fund.<ul type=""square""><li><b>Concentration Risk</b> &#8212; The Fund&#8217;s strategy of concentrating in science and technology and related companies means that its performance will be closely tied to the performance of a particular market segment. The Fund&#8217;s concentration in these companies may present more risks than if it were broadly diversified over numerous industries and sectors of the economy. A downturn in these companies would have a larger impact on the Fund than on a mutual fund that does not concentrate in such companies. At times, the performance of these companies will lag the performance of other industries or the broader market as a whole.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Convertible Securities Risk</b> &#8212; The market value of a convertible security performs like that of a regular debt security; that is, if market interest rates rise, the value of a convertible security usually falls. In addition, convertible securities are subject to the risk that the issuer will not be able to pay interest or dividends when due, and their market value may change based on changes in the issuer&#8217;s credit rating or the market&#8217;s perception of the issuer&#8217;s creditworthiness. Since it derives a portion of its value from the common stock into which it may be converted, a convertible security is also subject to the same types of market and issuer risks that apply to the underlying common stock.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Derivatives Risk</b> &#8212; The Fund&#8217;s use of derivatives may reduce the Fund&#8217;s returns and/or increase volatility. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, an index or a market to fluctuate significantly in price within a short time period. Derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund&#8217;s use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the overall securities markets. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund to value accurately. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Recent legislation calls for new regulation of the derivatives markets. The extent and impact of the regulation is not yet known and may not be known for some time. New regulation may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, or may otherwise adversely affect the value or performance of derivatives.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Emerging Markets Risk</b> &#8212; Emerging markets are riskier than more developed markets because they tend to develop unevenly and may never fully develop. Investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative. Emerging markets are more likely to experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations, which adversely affect returns to U.S. investors. In addition, many emerging securities markets have far lower trading volumes and less liquidity than developed markets.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Equity Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Stock markets are volatile. The price of equity securities fluctuates based on changes in a company&#8217;s financial condition and overall market and economic conditions.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Foreign Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Foreign investments often involve special risks not present in U.S. investments that can increase the chances that the Fund will lose money. These risks include:<br/><br/>&#8212; The Fund generally holds its foreign securities and cash in foreign banks and securities depositories, which may be recently organized or new to the foreign custody business and may be subject to only limited or no regulatory oversight.<br/><br/>&#8212; Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the value of the Fund&#8217;s portfolio.<br/><br/>&#8212; The economies of certain foreign markets may not compare favorably with the economy of the United States with respect to such issues as growth of gross national product, reinvestment of capital, resources and balance of payments position.<br/><br/>&#8212; The governments of certain countries may prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on foreign investments in their capital markets or in certain industries.<br/><br/>&#8212; Many foreign governments do not supervise and regulate stock exchanges, brokers and the sale of securities to the same extent as does the United States and may not have laws to protect investors that are comparable to U.S. securities laws.<br/><br/>&#8212; Settlement and clearance procedures in certain foreign markets may result in delays in payment for or delivery of securities not typically associated with settlement and clearance of U.S. investments.<br/><br/>&#8212; The European financial markets have recently experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns in, or rising government debt levels of several European countries. These events have adversely affected the exchange rate of the Euro and may spread to other countries in Europe, including countries that do not use the Euro. These events may affect the value and liquidity of certain of the Fund&#8217;s investments.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Geographic Concentration Risk</b> &#8212; From time to time the Fund may invest a substantial amount of its assets in issuers located in a single country or a limited number of countries. If the Fund concentrates its investments in this manner, it assumes the risk that economic, political and social conditions in those countries will have a significant impact on its investment performance. The Fund&#8217;s investment performance may also be more volatile if it concentrates its investments in certain countries, especially emerging market countries.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Investment Style Risk</b> &#8212; Under certain market conditions, growth investments have performed better during the later stages of economic expansion. Therefore, this investment style may over time go in and out of favor. At times when the investment style used by the Fund is out of favor, the Fund may underperform other equity funds that use different investment styles.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Leverage Risk</b> &#8212; Some transactions may give rise to a form of economic leverage. These transactions may include, among others, derivatives, and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. The use of leverage may cause the Fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations or to meet any required asset segregation requirements. Increases and decreases in the value of the Fund&#8217;s portfolio will be magnified when the Fund uses leverage. </li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Market Risk and Selection Risk</b> &#8212; Market risk is the risk that one or more markets in which the Fund invests will go down in value, including the possibility that the markets will go down sharply and unpredictably. Selection risk is the risk that the securities selected by Fund management will underperform the markets, the relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds with similar investment objectives and investment strategies. This means you may lose money.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Mid-Cap Securities Risk</b> &#8212; The securities of mid-cap companies generally trade in lower volumes and are generally subject to greater and less predictable price changes than the securities of larger capitalization companies.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>&#8220;New Issues&#8221; Risk</b> &#8212; &#8220;New Issues&#8221; are initial public offerings of equity securities of U.S. and non-U.S. issuers. Securities issued in IPOs have no trading history, and information about the companies may be available for very limited periods. In addition, the prices of securities sold in IPOs may be highly volatile or may decline shortly after the initial public offering.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Small Cap Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Small cap companies may have limited product lines or markets. They may be less financially secure than larger, more established companies. They may depend on a more limited management group than larger capitalized companies.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Technology Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Certain technology related companies may face special risks that their products or services may not prove to be commercially successful. Technology related companies are also strongly affected by worldwide scientific or technological developments. As a result, their products may rapidly become obsolete. Such companies are also often subject to governmental regulation and may, therefore, be adversely affected by governmental policies.</li></ul>"

The Fund may invest up to 25% of its net assets in emerging market countries.<br/><br/>Some of the industries likely to be represented in the Fund&#8217;s portfolio holdings include: application software, IT consulting and services, internet software and services, networking equipment, telecom equipment, computer hardware, computer storage and peripherals, electronic equipment and instruments, semiconductors and equipment, aerospace and defense, electrical components and equipment, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, healthcare equipment and supplies, healthcare distribution and services, healthcare facilities, industrial gases, specialty chemicals, advanced materials, internet and catalog retail, integrated telecom services, alternative carriers and wireless telecommunication services.<br/><br/>The Fund seeks to invest primarily in common stock but may also invest in preferred stock and convertible securities. The Fund may also invest in Rule 144A securities, which are privately placed securities purchased by qualified institutional buyers. From time to time the Fund may invest in shares of companies through initial public offerings (&#8220;IPOs&#8221;).<br/><br/>The Fund may, when consistent with the Fund&#8217;s investment objective, buy or sell options or futures on a security or an index of securities and may buy options on a currency or a basket of currencies, or enter into foreign currency transactions, including swaps (collectively, commonly known as derivatives). The Fund typically uses derivatives as a substitute for taking a position in the underlying asset and/or as part of a strategy designed to reduce exposure to other risks, such as currency risk. The Fund may also use derivatives to enhance returns, in which case their use would involve leveraging risk. The Fund may seek to obtain market exposure to the securities in which it primarily invests by entering into a series of purchase and sale contracts or by using other investment techniques (such as reverse repurchase agreements or dollar rolls). The Fund may also use forward foreign currency exchange contracts (obligations to buy or sell a currency at a set rate in the future)."

Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000001510_MemberInvestorInstitutionalAndRShares_Member,,,,,"Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in Science & Technology Opportunities, as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment, may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. The following is a summary description of principal risks of investing in the Fund.<ul type=""square""><li><b>Concentration Risk</b> &#8212; The Fund&#8217;s strategy of concentrating in science and technology and related companies means that its performance will be closely tied to the performance of a particular market segment. The Fund&#8217;s concentration in these companies may present more risks than if it were broadly diversified over numerous industries and sectors of the economy. A downturn in these companies would have a larger impact on the Fund than on a mutual fund that does not concentrate in such companies. At times, the performance of these companies will lag the performance of other industries or the broader market as a whole.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Convertible Securities Risk</b> &#8212; The market value of a convertible security performs like that of a regular debt security; that is, if market interest rates rise, the value of a convertible security usually falls. In addition, convertible securities are subject to the risk that the issuer will not be able to pay interest or dividends when due, and their market value may change based on changes in the issuer&#8217;s credit rating or the market&#8217;s perception of the issuer&#8217;s creditworthiness. Since it derives a portion of its value from the common stock into which it may be converted, a convertible security is also subject to the same types of market and issuer risks that apply to the underlying common stock.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Derivatives Risk</b> &#8212; The Fund&#8217;s use of derivatives may reduce the Fund&#8217;s returns and/or increase volatility. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, an index or a market to fluctuate significantly in price within a short time period. Derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund&#8217;s use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the overall securities markets. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund to value accurately. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Recent legislation calls for new regulation of the derivatives markets. The extent and impact of the regulation is not yet known and may not be known for some time. New regulation may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, or may otherwise adversely affect the value or performance of derivatives.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Emerging Markets Risk</b> &#8212; Emerging markets are riskier than more developed markets because they tend to develop unevenly and may never fully develop. Investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative.<br/>Emerging markets are more likely to experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations, which adversely affect returns to U.S. investors. In addition, many emerging securities markets have far lower trading volumes and less liquidity than developed markets.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Equity Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Stock markets are volatile. The price of equity securities fluctuates based on changes in a company&#8217;s financial condition and overall market and economic conditions.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Foreign Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Foreign investments often involve special risks not present in U.S. investments that can increase the chances that the Fund will lose money. These risks include:<br/><br/>&#8212; The Fund generally holds its foreign securities and cash in foreign banks and securities depositories, which may be recently organized or new to the foreign custody business and may be subject to only limited or no regulatory oversight.<br/><br/>&#8212; Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the value of the Fund&#8217;s portfolio.<br/><br/>&#8212; The economies of certain foreign markets may not compare favorably with the economy of the United States with respect to such issues as growth of gross national product, reinvestment of capital, resources and balance of payments position.<br/><br/>&#8212; The governments of certain countries may prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on foreign investments in their capital markets or in certain industries.<br/><br/>&#8212; Many foreign governments do not supervise and regulate stock exchanges, brokers and the sale of securities to the same extent as does the United States and may not have laws to protect investors that are comparable to U.S. securities laws.<br/><br/>&#8212; Settlement and clearance procedures in certain foreign markets may result in delays in payment for or delivery of securities not typically associated with settlement and clearance of U.S. investments.<br/><br/>&#8212; The European financial markets have recently experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns in, or rising government debt levels of several European countries. These events have adversely affected the exchange rate of the Euro and may spread to other countries in Europe, including countries that do not use the Euro. These events may affect the value and liquidity of certain of the Fund&#8217;s investments.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Geographic Concentration Risk</b> &#8212; From time to time the Fund may invest a substantial amount of its assets in issuers located in a single country or a limited number of countries. If the Fund concentrates its investments in this manner, it assumes the risk that economic, political and social conditions in those countries will have a significant impact on its investment performance. The Fund&#8217;s investment performance may also be more volatile if it concentrates its investments in certain countries, especially emerging market countries.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Investment Style Risk</b> &#8212; Under certain market conditions, growth investments have performed better during the later stages of economic expansion. Therefore, this investment style may over time go in and out of favor. At times when the investment style used by the Fund is out of favor, the Fund may underperform other equity funds that use different investment styles.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Leverage Risk</b> &#8212; Some transactions may give rise to a form of economic leverage. These transactions may include, among others, derivatives, and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. The use of leverage may cause the Fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations or to meet any required asset segregation requirements. Increases and decreases in the value of the Fund&#8217;s portfolio will be magnified when the Fund uses leverage.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li> <b>Market Risk and Selection Risk</b> &#8212; Market risk is the risk that one or more markets in which the Fund invests will go down in value, including the possibility that the markets will go down sharply and unpredictably. Selection risk is the risk that the securities selected by Fund management will underperform the markets, the relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds with similar investment objectives and investment strategies. This means you may lose money.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Mid-Cap Securities Risk</b> &#8212; The securities of mid-cap companies generally trade in lower volumes and are generally subject to greater and less predictable price changes than the securities of larger capitalization companies.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b> &#8220;New Issues&#8221; Risk</b> &#8212; &#8220;New Issues&#8221; are initial public offerings of equity securities of U.S. and non-U.S. issuers. Securities issued in IPOs have no trading history, and information about the companies may be available for very limited periods. In addition, the prices of securities sold in IPOs may be highly volatile or may decline shortly after the initial public offering.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Small Cap Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Small cap companies may have limited product lines or markets. They may be less financially secure than larger, more established companies. They may depend on a more limited management group than larger capitalized companies.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Technology Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Certain technology related companies may face special risks that their products or services may not prove to be commercially successful. Technology related companies are also strongly affected by worldwide scientific or technological developments. As a result, their products may rapidly become obsolete. Such companies are also often subject to governmental regulation and may, therefore, be adversely affected by governmental policies.</li></ul>"

Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000001877_MemberInvestorInstitutionalAndRShares_Member,,,,,"Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in Health Sciences Opportunities, as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment, may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. The following is a summary description of principal risks of investing in the Fund.<ul type=""square""><li><b>Concentration Risk</b> &#8212; The Fund&#8217;s strategy of concentrating in health sciences and related companies means that its performance will be closely tied to the performance of a particular market segment. The Fund&#8217;s concentration in these companies may present more risks than if it were broadly diversified over numerous industries and sectors of the economy. A downturn in these companies would have a larger impact on the Fund than on a mutual fund that does not concentrate in such companies. At times, the performance of these companies will lag the performance of other industries or the broader market as a whole.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Equity Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Stock markets are volatile. The price of equity securities fluctuates based on changes in a company&#8217;s financial condition and overall market and economic conditions.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Foreign Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Foreign investments often involve special risks not present in U.S. investments that can increase the chances that the Fund will lose money. These risks include:<br/><br/>&#8212;  The Fund generally holds its foreign securities and cash in foreign banks and securities depositories, which may be recently organized or new to the foreign custody business and may be subject to only limited or no regulatory oversight.<br/><br/>&#8212; Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the value of the Fund&#8217;s portfolio.<br/><br/>&#8212; The economies of certain foreign markets may not compare favorably with the economy of the United States with respect to such issues as growth of gross national product, reinvestment of capital, resources and balance of payments position.<br/><br/>&#8212; The governments of certain countries may prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on foreign investments in their capital markets or in certain industries.<br/><br/>&#8212; Many foreign governments do not supervise and regulate stock exchanges, brokers and the sale of securities to the same extent as does the United States and may not have laws to protect investors that are comparable to U.S. securities laws.<br/><br/>&#8212; Settlement and clearance procedures in certain foreign markets may result in delays in payment for or delivery of securities not typically associated with settlement and clearance of U.S. investments.<br/><br/>&#8212; The European financial markets have recently experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns in, or rising government debt levels of several European countries. These events have adversely affected the exchange rate of the Euro and may spread to other countries in Europe, including countries that do not use the Euro. These events may affect the value and liquidity of certain of the Fund&#8217;s investments.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Healthcare-Related Securities Risk </b>&#8212; Many healthcare-related companies are smaller and less seasoned than companies in other sectors. Healthcare-related companies may also be strongly affected by scientific or technological developments and their products may quickly become obsolete. Many healthcare companies are heavily dependent on patent protection and the actual or perceived safety and efficiency of their products. The expiration of patents may adversely affect the profitability of these companies. Many healthcare companies are subject to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar claims. Finally, many healthcare-related companies offer products and services that are subject to governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by changes in governmental policies or laws. In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act designed to reform the healthcare industry. The Fund cannot predict the impact of this legislation on healthcare-related companies or what healthcare-related proposals might be proposed or enacted in the future.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Investment Style Risk</b> &#8212; Under certain market conditions, growth investments have performed better during the later stages of economic expansion. Therefore, this investment style may over time go in and out of favor. At times when the investment style used by the Fund is out of favor, the Fund may underperform other equity funds that use different investment styles.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Market Risk and Selection Risk</b> &#8212; Market risk is the risk that one or more markets in which the Fund invests will go down in value, including the possibility that the markets will go down sharply and unpredictably. Selection risk is the risk that the securities selected by Fund management will underperform the markets, the relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds with similar investment objectives and investment strategies. This means you may lose money.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Mid-Cap Securities Risk</b> &#8212; The securities of mid-cap companies generally trade in lower volumes and are generally subject to greater and less predictable price changes than the securities of larger capitalization companies.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Non-Diversification Risk</b> &#8212; The Fund is a non-diversified fund. Because the Fund may invest in securities of a smaller number of issuers, it may be more exposed to the risks associated with and developments affecting an individual issuer than a fund that invests more widely.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Small Cap Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Small cap companies may have limited product lines or markets. They may be less financially secure than larger, more established companies. They may depend on a more limited management group than larger capitalized companies.</li></ul>"

Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000001877_MemberServiceShares_Member,,,,,"Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in Health Sciences Opportunities, as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment, may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. The following is a summary description of principal risks of investing in the Fund.<ul type=""square""><li><b>Concentration Risk</b> &#8212; The Fund&#8217;s strategy of concentrating in health sciences and related companies means that its performance will be closely tied to the performance of a particular market segment. The Fund&#8217;s concentration in these companies may present more risks than if it were broadly diversified over numerous industries and sectors of the economy. A downturn in these companies would have a larger impact on the Fund than on a mutual fund that does not concentrate in such companies. At times, the performance of these companies will lag the performance of other industries or the broader market as a whole.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Equity Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Stock markets are volatile. The price of equity securities fluctuates based on changes in a company&#8217;s financial condition and overall market and economic conditions.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Foreign Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Foreign investments often involve special risks not present in U.S. investments that can increase the chances that the Fund will lose money. These risks include:<br /><br />&#8212; The Fund generally holds its foreign securities and cash in foreign banks and securities depositories, which may be recently organized or new to the foreign custody business and may be subject to only limited or no regulatory oversight.<br /><br />&#8212; Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the value of the Fund&#8217;s portfolio.<br /><br />&#8212; The economies of certain foreign markets may not compare favorably with the economy of the United States with respect to such issues as growth of gross national product, reinvestment of capital, resources and balance of payments position.<br /><br />&#8212; The governments of certain countries may prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on foreign investments in their capital markets or in certain industries.<br /><br />&#8212; Many foreign governments do not supervise and regulate stock exchanges, brokers and the sale of securities to the same extent as does the United States and may not have laws to protect investors that are comparable to U.S. securities laws.<br /><br />&#8212; Settlement and clearance procedures in certain foreign markets may result in delays in payment for or delivery of securities not typically associated with settlement and clearance of U.S. investments.<br /><br />&#8212; The European financial markets have recently experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns in, or rising government debt levels of several European countries. These events have adversely affected the exchange rate of the Euro and may spread to other countries in Europe, including countries that do not use the Euro. These events may affect the value and liquidity of certain of the Fund&#8217;s investments.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Healthcare-Related Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Many healthcare-related companies are smaller and less seasoned than companies in other sectors. Healthcare-related companies may also be strongly affected by scientific or technological developments and their products may quickly become obsolete. Many healthcare companies are heavily dependent on patent protection and the actual or perceived safety and efficiency of their products. The expiration of patents may adversely affect the profitability of these companies. Many healthcare companies are subject to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar claims. Finally, many healthcare-related companies offer products and services that are subject to governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by changes in governmental policies or laws. In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act designed to reform the healthcare industry. The Fund cannot predict the impact of this legislation on healthcare-related companies or what healthcare-related proposals might be proposed or enacted in the future.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Investment Style Risk</b> &#8212; Under certain market conditions, growth investments have performed better during the later stages of economic expansion. Therefore, this investment style may over time go in and out of favor. At times when the investment style used by the Fund is out of favor, the Fund may underperform other equity funds that use different investment styles.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Market Risk and Selection Risk</b> &#8212; Market risk is the risk that one or more markets in which the Fund invests will go down in value, including the possibility that the markets will go down sharply and unpredictably. Selection risk is the risk that the securities selected by Fund management will underperform the markets, the relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds with similar investment objectives and investment strategies. This means you may lose money.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Mid-Cap Securities Risk</b> &#8212; The securities of mid-cap companies generally trade in lower volumes and are generally subject to greater and less predictable price changes than the securities of larger capitalization companies.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Non-Diversification Risk</b> &#8212; The Fund is a non-diversified fund. Because the Fund may invest in securities of a smaller number of issuers, it may be more exposed to the risks associated with and developments affecting an individual issuer than a fund that invests more widely.</li></ul><ul type=""square""><li><b>Small Cap Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Small cap companies may have limited product lines or markets. They may be less financially secure than larger, more established companies. They may depend on a more limited management group than larger capitalized companies.</li></ul>"

Performance Narrative [Text Block],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000001877_MemberServiceShares_Member,,,,,"On January 31, 2005, Health Sciences Opportunities reorganized with the State Street Research Health Sciences Fund (the &#8220;SSR Fund&#8221;), which had investment objectives and strategies substantially similar to the Fund. For periods prior to January 31, 2005, the chart and table show performance information for the SSR Fund. The performance of Service Shares for the period before January 28, 2005 is based on the performance of Investor A Shares, adjusted to reflect the class specific fees applicable to Service Shares at the time of such share class&#8217; launch. This information may be considered when assessing the Fund&#8217;s performance, but does not represent the actual performance of Service Shares.<br/><br/>The information shows you how the Fund&#8217;s performance has varied year by year and provides some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund. The table compares the Fund&#8217;s performance to that of the Standard & Poor&#8217;s (S&P) 500<sup>&#174;</sup> Index. The table also compares the Fund&#8217;s performance to that of the Russell 3000<sup>&#174;</sup> Health Care Index, which is relevant to the Fund because it has characteristics similar to the Fund&#8217;s investment strategies. As with all such investments, past performance (before and after taxes) is not an indication of future results. Sales charges are not reflected in the bar chart. If they were, returns would be less than those shown. However, the table includes all applicable fees and sales charges. If BlackRock and its affiliates had not waived or reimbursed certain Fund expenses during these periods, the Fund&#8217;s returns would have been lower. Updated information on the Fund&#8217;s results can be obtained by visiting http://www.blackrock.com/funds or can be obtained by phone at (800) 882-0052."
