Strategy Narrative [Text Block],c_S000029000_AAAA,,,,,"<p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing under normal circumstances at least 80% of its assets in taxable municipal debt securities publicly issued under the Build America Bond program. The Build America Bond program was created as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the ""Act"") and provided for the issuance of taxable municipal securities on which the issuer receives U.S. Government subsidies for the interest paid (""Build America Bonds""). Because the U.S. Congress has not extended the Build America Bond program, issuance of Build America Bonds ceased on December 31, 2010. The Build America Bonds outstanding as of December 31, 2010 will continue to be eligible for U.S. Government subsidies for the interest paid for the life of the Build America Bonds. There can be no assurance when or if the Build America Bond program will be reinstated in any form.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund invests in U.S. dollar-denominated Fixed Income Instruments that are primarily investment grade, but may invest up to 20% of its total assets in high yield securities (""junk bonds"") rated B or higher by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (""Moody's""), or equivalently rated by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (""S&P"") or Fitch, Inc. (""Fitch""), or, if unrated, determined by Pacific Investment Management Company LLC (""PIMCO"") to be of comparable quality. ""Fixed Income Instruments"" include bonds, debt securities and other similar instruments issued by various U.S. and non-U.S. public- or private-sector entities. The average portfolio duration of the Fund normally varies within two years (plus or minus) of the portfolio duration of the securities comprising the Barclays Build America Bond Index, as calculated by PIMCO, which as of September 30, 2012, was 12.58 years. Duration is a measure used to determine the sensitivity of a security's price to changes in interest rates. The longer a security's duration, the more sensitive it will be to changes in interest rates.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">Municipal bonds generally are issued by or on behalf of states and local governments and their agencies, authorities and other instru- mentalities. Unlike most municipal bonds, interest received on Build America Bonds is subject to federal and state income tax. The Fund may invest 25% or more of its total assets in bonds that finance similar projects, such as those relating to education, health care, housing, transportation, and utilities. The portfolio manager focuses on bonds with the potential to offer attractive current income, typically looking for bonds that can provide consistently attractive current yields or that are trading at competitive market prices. The Fund may purchase and sell securities on a when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment basis. The Fund may, without limitation, seek to obtain market exposure to the securities in which it primarily invests by entering into a series of purchase and sale con- tracts or by using other investment techniques (such as buy backs).</p>"

               <b>Market Trading Risk:</b> the risk that an active secondary trading market for Fund shares does not continue once developed, that the Fund may not continue to meet a listing exchange's trading or listing requirements, or that Fund shares trade at prices other than the Fund's net asset value</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Limited Issuance Risk:</b> the risk that Build America Bonds will not be actively traded, that the Fund may experience difficulty in locating suitable Build America Bonds for purchase, that the non-extension of the program will negatively affect the value of existing Build America Bonds and that Build America Bonds may experience greater illiquidity as compared to other municipal obligations</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Interest Rate Risk:</b> the risk that fixed income securities will decline in value because of an increase in interest rates; a fund with a longer average portfolio duration will be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than a fund with a shorter average portfolio duration</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Credit Risk:</b> the risk that the Fund could lose money if the issuer or guarantor of a fixed income security, or the counterparty to a forward commitment transaction, is unable or unwilling to meet its financial obligations</p>

               <b>High Yield Risk:</b> the risk that high yield securities and unrated securities of similar credit quality (commonly known as ""junk bonds"") are subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risks. High yield securities are considered primarily speculative with respect to the issuer's continuing ability to make principal and interest payments</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Market Risk:</b> the risk that the value of securities owned by the Fund may go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably, due to factors affecting securities markets generally or particular sectors</p>

               <b>Issuer Non-Diversification Risk:</b> the risks of focusing investments in a small number of issuers, including being more susceptible to risks associated with a single economic, political or regulatory occurrence than a more diversified portfolio might be. Funds that are ""non-diversified"" may invest a greater percentage of their assets in the securities of a single issuer (such as bonds issued by a particular foreign government) than funds that are ""diversified""</p>

               <b>Leveraging Risk:</b> the risk that certain transactions of the Fund, such as reverse repurchase agreements, loans of portfolio securities, and the use of when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment transactions, may give rise to leverage, causing the Fund to be more volatile than if it had not been leveraged</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Management Risk:</b> the risk that the investment techniques and risk analyses applied by PIMCO and each portfolio manager will not produce the desired results, and that legislative, regulatory, or tax restrictions, policies or developments may affect the investment techniques available to PIMCO and each portfolio manager in connection with managing the Fund.

The Fund seeks exposure to foreign (non-U.S.) currencies likely to outperform the U.S. dollar over the long-term. Assets not invested in currencies or Fixed Income Instruments denominated in currencies of non-U.S. countries may be invested in other types of Fixed Income Instruments. ""Fixed Income Instruments"" include bonds, debt securities and other similar instruments issued by various U.S. and non-U.S. public- or private-sector entities.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund may invest in the currencies and Fixed Income Instruments of emerging market countries. PIMCO will select the Fund's country and currency composition based on its evaluation of relative interest rates, inflation rates, exchange rates, monetary and fiscal policies, trade and current account balances, legal and political developments and other specific factors PIMCO believes to be relevant. The Fund will normally limit its exposure to a single non-U.S. currency (from currency holdings or investments in securities denominated in that currency) to 20% of its total assets.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The average portfolio duration of this Fund varies based on PIMCO's forecast for interest rates and, under normal market conditions, will vary from zero to three years. Duration is a measure used to determine the sensitivity of a security's price to changes in interest rates. The longer a security's duration, the more sensitive it will be to changes in interest rates.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund may invest in both investment grade securities and high yield securities (""junk bonds"") rated Ba or higher by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (""Moody's""), or equivalently rated by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (""S&P"") or Fitch, Inc. (""Fitch""), or, if unrated, determined by PIMCO to be of comparable quality. The Fund is non-diversified, which means that it may invest its assets in a smaller number of issuers than a diversified fund.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund may purchase or sell securities on a when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment basis and may engage in short sales. The Fund may, without limitation, seek to obtain market exposure to the securities in which it primarily invests by entering into a series of purchase and sale contracts or by using other investment techniques (such as buy backs or dollar rolls). The ""total return"" sought by the Fund consists of income and capital appreciation, if any, which generally arises from decreases in interest rates, foreign currency appreciation, or improving credit fundamentals for a particular sector or security.</p>"

Strategy Narrative [Text Block],c_S000031063_AAAA,,,,,"<p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing under normal circumstances at least 80% of its assets in inflation-linked bonds that are economically tied to at least three developed and emerging market countries (one of which may be the United States). Inflation-linked bonds are fixed income securities that are structured to provide protection against inflation. The value of the bond's principal or the interest income paid on the bond is adjusted to track changes in an official inflation measure. The effective portfolio duration of this Fund normally varies within two years (plus or minus) of the effective portfolio duration of the securities comprising the PIMCO Global Advantage Inflation-Linked Bond Index®, as calculated by PIMCO, which as of September 30, 2012, as converted was 7.96 years. Duration is a measure used to determine the sensitivity of a security's price to changes in interest rates. The longer a security's duration, the more sensitive it will be to changes in interest rates. Effective duration takes into account that for certain bonds expected cash flows will fluctuate as interest rates change and is defined in nominal yield terms, which is market convention for most bond investors and managers. Because market convention for bonds is to use nominal yields to measure duration, duration for inflation-linked bonds, which are based on real yields, are converted to nominal durations through a conversion factor. The resulting nominal duration typically can range from 20% and 90% of the respective real duration. All security holdings will be measured in effective (nominal) duration terms. Similarly, the effective duration of the PIMCO Global Advantage Inflation-Linked Bond Index® will be calculated using the same conversion factors.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund primarily invests in debt securities rated Baa or higher by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (""Moody's""), or equivalently rated by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (""S&P"") or Fitch, Inc. (""Fitch""), or, if unrated, determined by PIMCO to be of comparable quality. The Fund may obtain foreign currency exposure (from non-U.S. dollar denominated securities or currencies) without limitation. The Fund may invest, without limitation, in securities and instruments of foreign (non-U.S.) issuers, including securities and instruments economically tied to emerging market countries. The Fund may enter into foreign currency transactions (such as currency forwards). The Fund may purchase and sell securities on a when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment basis. The Fund may, without limitation, seek to obtain market exposure to the securities in which it primarily invests by entering into a series of purchase and sale contracts or by using other investment techniques (such as buy backs or dollar rolls). The Fund is non-diversified, which means that it may invest its assets in a smaller number of issuers than a diversified fund.</p>"

Strategy Narrative [Text Block],c_S000026755_AAAA,,,,,"<p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing under normal circumstances at least 80% of its assets in a diversified portfolio of debt securities whose interest is, in the opinion of bond counsel for the issuer at the time of issuance, exempt from federal income tax (""Municipal Bonds""). Municipal Bonds generally are issued by or on behalf of states and local governments and their agencies, authorities and other instrumentalities.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund does not intend to invest in securities whose interest is subject to the federal alternative minimum tax. The Fund may only invest in U.S. dollar-denominated investment grade debt securities, rated Baa or higher by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (""Moody's""), or equivalently rated by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (""S&P"") or Fitch, Inc. (""Fitch""), or, if unrated, determined by Pacific Investment Management Company LLC (""PIMCO"") to be of comparable quality. The Fund may invest 25% or more of its total assets in Municipal Bonds that finance similar projects, such as those relating to education, health care, housing, transportation, and utilities, and 25% or more of its total assets in industrial development bonds. The average portfolio duration of this Fund normally varies from three to eight years, based on PIMCO's forecast for interest rates. Duration is a measure used to determine the sensitivity of a security's price to changes in interest rates. The longer a security's duration, the more sensitive it will be to changes in interest rates. The portfolio manager focuses on bonds with the potential to offer attractive current income, typically looking for bonds that can provide consistently attractive current yields or that are trading at competitive market prices.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund may purchase and sell securities on a when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment basis. The Fund may, without limitation, seek to obtain market exposure to the securities in which it primarily invests by entering into a series of purchase and sale contracts or by using other investment techniques (such as buy backs or dollar rolls).</p>"

Strategy Narrative [Text Block],c_S000026754_AAAA,,,,,"<p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing under normal circumstances at least 80% of its assets in a diversified portfolio of debt securities whose interest is, in the opinion of bond counsel for the issuer at the time of issuance, exempt from federal income tax (""Municipal Bonds""). Municipal Bonds generally are issued by or on behalf of states and local governments and their agencies, authorities and other instrumentalities.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund does not intend to invest in securities whose interest is subject to the federal alternative minimum tax. The Fund may only invest in U.S. dollar-denominated investment grade debt securities, rated Baa or higher by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (""Moody's""), or equivalently rated by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (""S&P"") or Fitch, Inc. (""Fitch""), or, if unrated, determined by Pacific Investment Management Company LLC ('PIMCO"") to be of comparable quality. The Fund may invest 25% or more of its total assets in Municipal Bonds that finance similar projects, such as those relating to education, health care, housing, transportation, and utilities, and 25% or more of its total assets in industrial development bonds. The average portfolio duration of this Fund varies based on PIMCO's forecast for interest rates and under normal market conditions is not expected to exceed three years. Duration is a measure used to determine the sensitivity of a security's price to changes in interest rates. The longer a security's duration, the more sensitive it will be to changes in interest rates. The dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity of the Fund is normally not expected to exceed three years. The portfolio manager focuses on bonds with the potential to offer attractive current income, typically looking for bonds that can provide consistently attractive current yields or that are trading at competitive market prices.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund may purchase and sell securities on a when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment basis. The Fund may, without limitation, seek to obtain market exposure to the securities in which it primarily invests by entering into a series of purchase and sale contracts or by using other investment techniques (such as buy backs or dollar rolls).</p>"

Strategy Narrative [Text Block],c_S000034260_BBBB,,,,,"<p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing under normal circumstances at least 80% of its total assets (exclusive of collateral held from securities lending) in the component securities (""Component Securities"") of The BofA Merrill Lynch Diversified Australia Bond Index℠ (the ""Underlying Index""). The Fund may invest the remainder of its assets in Fixed Income Instruments that are not Component Securities, but which PIMCO believes will help the Fund track its Underlying Index, as well as in cash and investment grade, liquid short-term instruments, forwards or derivatives, such as options, futures contracts or swap agreements, and shares of affiliated bond funds. ""Fixed Income Instruments"" include bonds, debt securities and other similar instruments issued by various U.S. and non-U.S. public- or private-sector entities. The average portfolio duration of this Fund will closely correspond to the portfolio duration of the securities comprising its Underlying Index, which as of September 30, 2012 was 4.24 years. Duration is a measure used to determine the sensitivity of a security's price to changes in interest rates. The longer a security's duration, the more sensitive it will be to changes in interest rates.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Underlying Index tracks the performance of large, Australian dollar (""AUD"")-denominated investment grade debt instruments publicly issued in the Australian domestic market, including sovereign, quasi-government, corporate, securitized and collateralized securities. As of September 30, 2012, there were 222 issues in the Underlying Index. Qualifying constituents must have an investment grade rating (based on an average of Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (""Moody's""), Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (""S&P"") and Fitch, Inc. (""Fitch"")), an investment grade country of risk (based on an average of Moody's, S&P and Fitch foreign currency long term sovereign debt ratings), at least one year remaining term to final maturity and a fixed coupon schedule. Callable perpetual securities qualify provided they are at least one year from the first call date. Fixed-to-floating rate securities also qualify provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">Qualifying Australian sovereign securities must have a minimum amount outstanding of AUD 1 billion. Both nominal and inflation linked local currency Australia sovereign debt are included in the Underlying Index. Original issue zero coupon bonds are included in the Underlying Index and the amounts outstanding of qualifying coupon securities are not reduced by any portions that have been stripped. Qualifying non-sovereign securities must have a minimum amount outstanding of AUD 500 million. Original issue zero coupon bonds, ""global"" securities (debt issued simultaneously in the eurobond and Australian domestic bond markets) and corporate pay-in-kind securities, including toggle notes, qualify for inclusion in the Underlying Index. Defaulted securities are excluded from the Underlying Index. The Underlying Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">PIMCO uses an indexing approach in managing the Fund's investments. The Fund employs a representative sampling strategy in seeking to achieve its investment objective. In using this strategy, PIMCO seeks to invest in a combination of Component Securities and other instruments such that the combination effectively provides exposure to the Underlying Index. In using a representative sampling strategy, the Fund may not track its Underlying Index with the same degree of accuracy as a fund that replicates the composition of the Underlying Index. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not attempt to outperform the index the Fund tracks. An indexing approach may eliminate the chance that the Fund will substantially outperform its Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs by keeping portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund is non-diversified, which means that it may invest its assets in a smaller number of issuers than a diversified fund. The Fund may invest in derivative instruments, such as options, futures contracts or swap agreements. The Fund may purchase and sell securities on a when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment basis. The Fund may, without limitation, seek to obtain market exposure to the securities in which it primarily invests by entering into a series of purchase and sale contracts or by using other investment techniques (such as buy backs). The ""total return"" sought by the Fund consists of income earned on the Fund's investments, plus capital appreciation, if any, which generally arises from decreases in interest rates, foreign currency appreciation, or improving credit fundamentals for a particular sector or security.</p>"

               <b>Market Trading Risk:</b> the risk that an active secondary trading market for Fund shares does not continue once developed, that the Fund may not continue to meet a listing exchange's trading or listing requirements, or that Fund shares trade at prices other than the Fund's net asset value</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Australian Securities Risk:</b> the Australian economy is heavily dependent upon trade and any reduction in trading with its key partners may cause an adverse impact on the Australian economy and the securities in which the Fund invests. The Fund is therefore exposed to the risks that could affect the economies of its Asian, Australasian, European and American trading partners, such as fluctuations in commodities markets, exchange rates, high unemployment, trade regulations and deficits, among others. Additionally, Australia is prone to natural disasters, which could further impact the Australian economy.</p>

               <b>Interest Rate Risk:</b> the risk that fixed income securities will decline in value because of an increase in interest rates; a fund with a longer average portfolio duration will be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than a fund with a shorter average portfolio duration</p>

               <b>Derivatives Risk:</b> the risk of investing in derivative instruments, including liquidity, interest rate, market, credit and management risks, mispricing or improper valuation. Changes in the value of the derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying asset, rate or index, and the Fund could lose more than the principal amount invested</p>

Strategy Narrative [Text Block],c_S000026340_BBBB,,,,,"<p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing under normal circumstances at least 80% of its total assets (exclusive of collateral held from securities lending) in the component securities (""Component Securities"") of The BofA Merrill Lynch Liquid US Treasury Index℠ (the ""Underlying Index""). The Fund may invest the remainder of its assets in Fixed Income Instruments that are not Component Securities, but which Pacific Investment Management Company LLC (""PIMCO"") believes will help the Fund track its Underlying Index, as well as in cash and investment grade, liquid short-term instruments, forwards or derivatives, such as options, futures contracts or swap agreements, and shares of affiliated bond funds. ""Fixed Income Instruments"" include bonds, debt securities and other similar instruments issued by various U.S. and non-U.S. public- or private-sector entities. The average portfolio duration of this Fund will closely correspond to the portfolio duration of the securities comprising its Underlying Index, as calculated by PIMCO, which as of September 30, 2012 was 7.75 years. Duration is a measure used to determine the sensitivity of a security's price to changes in interest rates. The longer a security's duration, the more sensitive it will be to changes in interest rates.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Underlying Index is an unmanaged index comprised of U.S. dollar denominated sovereign debt securities publicly issued by the U.S. Treasury. As of September 30, 2012, there were 18 issues in the Underlying Index. The securities in the Underlying Index have a minimum $1 billion of outstanding face value, are fixed-rate and are non-convertible. Bills, inflation-linked debt and strips are excluded from the Underlying Index; however, original issue zero coupon bonds are included in the Underlying Index and the amounts outstanding of qualifying coupon securities are not reduced by any portions that have been stripped. The Underlying Index is capitalization-weighted and the composition of Component Securities is updated monthly. Intra-month cash flows are reinvested daily, at the beginning-of-month 1-month Libid rate, until the end of the month at which point all cash is removed from the Underlying Index. It is not possible to invest directly in the Underlying Index. The Underlying Index does not reflect deductions for fees, expenses or taxes.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">PIMCO uses an indexing approach in managing the Fund's investments. The Fund employs a representative sampling strategy in seeking to achieve its investment objective. In using this strategy, PIMCO seeks to invest in a combination of Component Securities and other instruments such that the combination effectively provides exposure to the Underlying Index. In using a representative sampling strategy, the Fund may not track its Underlying Index with the same degree of accuracy as a fund that replicates the composition of the Underlying Index. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not attempt to outperform the index the Fund tracks. An indexing approach may eliminate the chance that the Fund will substantially outperform its Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs by keeping portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund may invest in derivative instruments, such as options, futures contracts or swap agreements. The Fund may purchase and sell securities on a when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment basis. The Fund may, without limitation, seek to obtain market exposure to the securities in which it primarily invests by entering into a series of purchase and sale contracts or by using other investment techniques (such as buy backs). The ""total return"" sought by the Fund consists of income earned on the Fund's investments, plus capital appreciation, if any, which generally arises from decreases in interest rates.</p>"

Strategy Narrative [Text Block],c_S000034261_BBBB,,,,,"<p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing under normal circumstances at least 80% of its total assets (exclusive of collateral held from securities lending) in the component securities (""Component Securities"") of The BofA Merrill Lynch Diversified Canada Government Bond Index℠ (the ""Underlying Index""). The Fund may invest the remainder of its assets in Fixed Income Instruments that are not Component Securities, but which PIMCO believes will help the Fund track its Underlying Index, as well as in cash and investment grade, liquid short-term instruments, forwards or derivatives, such as options, futures contracts or swap agreements, and shares of affiliated bond funds. ""Fixed Income Instruments"" include bonds, debt securities and other similar instruments issued by various U.S. and non-U.S. public- or private-sector entities. The average portfolio duration of this Fund will closely correspond to the portfolio duration of the securities comprising its Underlying Index, which as of September 30, 2012 was 9.25 years. Duration is a measure used to determine the sensitivity of a security's price to changes in interest rates. The longer a security's duration, the more sensitive it will be to changes in interest rates.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Underlying Index tracks the performance of large, Canadian dollar (""CAD"")-denominated investment grade debt instruments publicly issued in the Canadian domestic market, Canadian sovereign and quasi-government. As of September 30, 2012, there were 334 issues in the Underlying Index. Qualifying constituents must have an investment-grade rating (based on an average of the ratings of Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (""Moody's""), Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (""S&P"") and Fitch, Inc. (""Fitch"")), an investment grade country of risk (based on an average of Moody's, S&P and Fitch foreign currency long term sovereign debt ratings), at least one year remaining term to final maturity and a fixed coupon schedule.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">Qualifying Canadian sovereign securities must have a minimum amount outstanding of CAD 1 billion. Both nominal and inflation linked local currency Canada sovereign debt are included in the Underlying Index. Original issue zero coupon bonds are included in the Underlying Index and the amounts outstanding of qualifying coupon securities are not reduced by any portions that have been stripped. Qualifying quasi-government securities must have a minimum amount outstanding of CAD 200 million. Original issue zero coupon bonds and ""global"" securities (debt issued simultaneously in the eurobond and Canadian domestic bond markets) qualify for inclusion in the Underlying Index. The Underlying Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">PIMCO uses an indexing approach in managing the Fund's investments. The Fund employs a representative sampling strategy in seeking to achieve its investment objective. In using this strategy, PIMCO seeks to invest in a combination of Component Securities and other instruments such that the combination effectively provides exposure to the Underlying Index. In using a representative sampling strategy, the Fund may not track its Underlying Index with the same degree of accuracy as a fund that replicates the composition of the Underlying Index. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not attempt to outperform the index the Fund tracks. An indexing approach may eliminate the chance that the Fund will substantially outperform its Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs by keeping portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund is non-diversified, which means that it may invest its assets in a smaller number of issuers than a diversified fund. The Fund may invest in derivative instruments, such as options, futures contracts or swap agreements. The Fund may purchase and sell securities on a when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment basis. The Fund may, without limitation, seek to obtain market exposure to the securities in which it primarily invests by entering into a series of purchase and sale contracts or by using other investment techniques (such as buy backs). The ""total return"" sought by the Fund consists of income earned on the Fund's investments, plus capital appreciation, if any, which generally arises from decreases in interest rates, foreign currency appreciation, or improving credit fundamentals for a particular sector or security.</p>"

            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Market Trading Risk:</b> the risk that an active secondary trading market for Fund shares does not continue once developed, that the Fund may not continue to meet a listing exchange's trading or listing requirements, or that Fund shares trade at prices other than the Fund's net asset value</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Canadian Securities Risk:</b> the Canadian economy may be significantly affected by the U.S. economy because the U.S. is Canada's largest trading partner and foreign investor. Canada's largest exports are its natural resources, so the Canadian economy is dependent on the demand for, and supply and price of, natural resources, and any market developments that reduce the price of such goods could disproportionately affect the Canadian economy.</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Interest Rate Risk:</b> the risk that fixed income securities will decline in value because of an increase in interest rates; a fund with a longer average portfolio duration will be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than a fund with a shorter average portfolio duration</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Credit Risk:</b> the risk that the Fund could lose money if the issuer or guarantor of a fixed income security, or the counterparty to a derivative contract, is unable or unwilling to meet its financial obligations</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Market Risk:</b> the risk that the value of securities owned by the Fund may go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably, due to factors affecting securities markets generally or particular sectors</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Liquidity Risk:</b> the risk that a particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell and that the Fund may be unable to sell illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price or achieve its desired level of exposure to a certain sector</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Issuer Risk:</b> the risk that the value of a security or currency may decline for reasons directly related to the issuer, such as management performance, financial leverage and reduced demand for the issuer's goods or services</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Derivatives Risk:</b> the risk of investing in derivative instruments, including liquidity, interest rate, market, credit and management risks, mispricing or improper valuation. Changes in the value of the derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying asset, rate or index, and the Fund could lose more than the principal amount invested</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Mortgage-Related and Other Asset-Backed Risk:</b> the risk of investing in mortgage-related and other asset-backed securities, including interest rate risk, extension risk and prepayment risk</p>

               <b>Foreign (Non-U.S.) Investment Risk:</b> the risk that investing in foreign (non-U.S.) securities may result in the Fund experiencing more rapid and extreme changes in value than a fund that invests exclusively in securities of U.S. companies, due to smaller markets, differing reporting, accounting and auditing standards, increased risk of delayed settlement of portfolio transactions or loss of certificates of portfolio securities, and the risk of unfavorable foreign government actions, including nationalization, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, currency blockage, or political changes or diplomatic developments. Foreign securities may also be less liquid and more difficult to value than securities of U.S. issuers</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Currency Risk:</b> the risk that foreign currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar and affect the Fund's investments in foreign (non-U.S.) currencies or in securities that trade in, and receive revenues in, or in derivatives that provide exposure to, foreign (non-U.S.) currencies</p>

               <b>Issuer Non-Diversification Risk:</b> the risks of focusing investments in a small number of issuers, including being more susceptible to risks associated with a single economic, political or regulatory occurrence than a more diversified portfolio might be. Funds that are ""non-diversified"" may invest a greater percentage of their assets in the securities of a single issuer (such as bonds issued by a particular foreign government) than funds that are ""diversified""</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Leveraging Risk:</b> the risk that certain transactions of the Fund, such as reverse repurchase agreements, loans of portfolio securities, and the use of when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment transactions, or derivative instruments, may give rise to leverage, causing the Fund to be more volatile than if it had not been leveraged</p>

               <b>Management and Tracking Error Risk:</b> the risk that the portfolio manager's investment decisions may not produce the desired results or that the Fund's portfolio may not closely track the Underlying Index for a number of reasons.

Strategy Narrative [Text Block],c_S000034262_BBBB,,,,,"<p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing under normal circumstances at least 80% of its total assets (exclusive of collateral held from securities lending) in the component securities (""Component Securities"") of The BofA Merrill Lynch Diversified Germany Bond Index℠ (the ""Underlying Index""). The Fund may invest the remainder of its assets in Fixed Income Instruments that are not Component Securities, but which Pacific Investment Management Company LLC (""PIMCO"") believes will help the Fund track its Underlying Index, as well as in cash and investment grade, liquid short-term instruments, forwards or derivatives, such as options, futures contracts or swap agreements, and shares of affiliated bond funds. ""Fixed Income Instruments"" include bonds, debt securities and other similar instruments issued by various U.S. and non-U.S. public or private-sector entities. The average portfolio duration of this Fund will closely correspond to the portfolio duration of the securities comprising its Underlying Index, which as of September 30, 2012 was 4.30 years. Duration is a measure used to determine the sensitivity of a security's price to changes in interest rates. The longer a security's duration, the more sensitive it will be to changes in interest rates.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Underlying Index tracks the performance of large, Euro (""EUR"")-denominated investment grade debt instruments of German issuers publicly issued in the eurobond or Euro member domestic markets, including sovereign, quasi-government, corporate, securitized and collateralized securities. As of September 30, 2012, there were 639 issues in the Underlying Index. Qualifying constituents must be an obligation of a German entity with an investment-grade rating (based on an average of the ratings of Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (""Moody's""), Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (""S&P"") and Fitch, Inc. (""Fitch"")), at least one year remaining term to final maturity and a fixed coupon schedule. Callable perpetual securities qualify provided they are at least one year from the first call date. Fixed-to-floating rate securities also qualify provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">Qualifying German sovereign securities must have a minimum amount outstanding of EUR 1 billion. Both nominal and inflation linked local currency German sovereign debt are included in the Underlying Index. Original issue zero coupon bonds and corporate pay-in-kind securities, including toggle notes, are included in the Underlying Index and the amounts outstanding of qualifying coupon securities are not reduced by any portions that have been stripped. Qualifying non-sovereign securities must have a minimum amount outstanding of EUR 500 million. Original issue zero coupon securities qualify for inclusion in the Underlying Index. The Underlying Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">PIMCO uses an indexing approach in managing the Fund's investments. The Fund employs a representative sampling strategy in seeking to achieve its investment objective. In using this strategy, PIMCO seeks to invest in a combination of Component Securities and other instruments such that the combination effectively provides exposure to the Underlying Index. In using a representative sampling strategy, the Fund may not track its Underlying Index with the same degree of accuracy as a fund that replicates the composition of the Underlying Index. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not attempt to outperform the index the Fund tracks. An indexing approach may eliminate the chance that the Fund will substantially outperform its Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs by keeping portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund is non-diversified, which means that it may invest its assets in a smaller number of issuers than a diversified fund. The Fund may invest in derivative instruments, such as options, futures contracts or swap agreements. The Fund may purchase and sell securities on a when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment basis. The Fund may, without limitation, seek to obtain market exposure to the securities in which it primarily invests by entering into a series of purchase and sale contracts or by using other investment techniques (such as buy backs). The ""total return"" sought by the Fund consists of income earned on the Fund's investments, plus capital appreciation, if any, which generally arises from decreases in interest rates, foreign currency appreciation, or improving credit fundamentals for a particular sector or security.</p>"

            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Market Trading Risk:</b> the risk that an active secondary trading market for Fund shares does not continue once developed, that the Fund may not continue to meet a listing exchange's trading or listing requirements, or that Fund shares trade at prices other than the Fund's net asset value</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>German Securities Risk:</b> the German economy is dependent on trade, with exports accounting for more than one-third of Germany's output. Therefore, a reduction in spending by Germany's trade partners on German products and services or negative changes in any of these countries may cause an adverse impact on the German economy. Internal factors, such as high unemployment and government regulation of labor markets, may also affect the performance of the German economy. The European financial markets have recently experienced volatility due to concerns about rising government debt levels of several European countries.</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Interest Rate Risk:</b> the risk that fixed income securities will decline in value because of an increase in interest rates; a fund with a longer average portfolio duration will be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than a fund with a shorter average portfolio duration</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Credit Risk:</b> the risk that the Fund could lose money if the issuer or guarantor of a fixed income security, or the counterparty to a derivative contract, is unable or unwilling to meet its financial obligations</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Market Risk:</b> the risk that the value of securities owned by the Fund may go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably, due to factors affecting securities markets generally or particular sectors</p>

               <b>Derivatives Risk:</b> the risk of investing in derivative instruments, including liquidity, interest rate, market, credit and management risks, mispricing or improper valuation. Changes in the value of the derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying asset, rate or index, and the Fund could lose more than the principal amount invested</p>

               <b>Foreign (Non-U.S.) Investment Risk:</b> the risk that investing in foreign (non-U.S.) securities may result in the Fund experiencing more rapid and extreme changes in value than a fund that invests exclusively in securities of U.S. companies, due to smaller markets, differing reporting, accounting and auditing standards, increased risk of delayed settlement of portfolio transactions or loss of certificates of portfolio securities, and the risk of unfavorable foreign government actions, including nationalization, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, currency blockage, or political changes or diplomatic developments. Foreign securities may also be less liquid and more difficult to value than securities of U.S. issuers</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Currency Risk:</b> the risk that foreign currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar and affect the Fund's investments in foreign (non-U.S.) currencies or in securities that trade in, and receive revenues in, or in derivatives that provide exposure to, foreign (non-U.S.) currencies</p>

               <b>Issuer Non-Diversification Risk:</b> the risks of focusing investments in a small number of issuers, including being more susceptible to risks associated with a single economic, political or regulatory occurrence than a more diversified portfolio might be. Funds that are ""non-diversified"" may invest a greater percentage of their assets in the securities of a single issuer (such as bonds issued by a particular foreign government) than funds that are ""diversified""</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Leveraging Risk:</b> the risk that certain transactions of the Fund, such as reverse repurchase agreements, loans of portfolio securities, and the use of when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment transactions, or derivative instruments, may give rise to leverage, causing the Fund to be more volatile than if it had not been leveraged</p>

               <b>Management and Tracking Error Risk:</b> the risk that the portfolio manager's investment decisions may not produce the desired results or that the Fund's portfolio may not closely track the Underlying Index for a number of reasons. The Fund incurs operating expenses, which are not applicable to the Underlying Index, and the costs of buying and selling securities, especially when rebalancing the Fund's portfolio to reflect changes in the composition of the Underlying Index. Performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary due to asset valuation differences and differences between the Fund's portfolio and the Underlying Index due to legal restrictions, cost or liquidity restraints. In addition, the Fund's use of a representative sampling approach may cause the Fund to be less correlated to the return of the Underlying Index than if the Fund held all of the securities in the Underlying Index</p>

Strategy Narrative [Text Block],c_S000028999_BBBB,,,,,"<p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing under normal circumstances at least 80% of its total assets (exclusive of collateral held from securities lending) in the component securities (""Component Securities"") of The BofA Merrill Lynch US Corporate Index℠ (the ""Underlying Index""). The Fund may invest the remainder of its assets in Fixed Income Instruments that are not Component Securities, but which PIMCO believes will help the Fund track its Underlying Index, as well as in cash and investment grade, liquid short-term instruments, forwards or derivatives, such as options, futures contracts or swap agreements, and shares of affiliated bond funds. ""Fixed Income Instruments"" include bonds, debt securities and other similar instruments issued by various U.S. and non-U.S. public- or private-sector entities. The Fund may invest in securities rated Baa or higher by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (""Moody's""), or equivalently rated by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (""S&P"") or Fitch, Inc. (""Fitch""), or, if unrated, determined by PIMCO to be of comparable quality. The average portfolio duration of this Fund will closely correspond to the portfolio duration of the securities comprising its Underlying Index, as calculated by PIMCO, which as of September 30, 2012 was 6.88 years. Duration is a measure used to determine the sensitivity of a security's price to changes in interest rates. The longer a security's duration, the more sensitive it will be to changes in interest rates.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Underlying Index is an unmanaged index comprised of U.S. dollar denominated investment grade corporate debt securities publicly issued in the U.S. domestic market with at least one year remaining term to final maturity. As of September 30, 2012, there were 5,320 issues in the Underlying Index. The securities comprising the Underlying Index have an investment grade rating (based on an average of the ratings of Moody's, S&P and Fitch) and an investment grade rated country of risk (based on an average of Moody's, S&P and Fitch foreign currency long term sovereign debt ratings). In addition, qualifying securities must have a minimum $250 million of outstanding face value and a fixed coupon schedule. Original issue zero coupon bonds, debt issued simultaneously in the Eurobond and U.S. domestic bond markets, 144A securities and corporate pay-in-kind securities qualify for inclusion in the Underlying Index. Callable perpetual securities qualify for inclusion in the Underlying Index provided they are at least one year from the first call date. Fixed-to-floating rate securities also qualify provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at least one year from last call prior to the date the bond transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security. The Underlying Index is capitalization-weighted and the composition of Component Securities is updated monthly. Cash flows from bond payments that are received during the month are retained in the Underlying Index, without earning reinvestment income, until removal at the end of the month as part of the rebalancing. It is not possible to invest directly in the Underlying Index. The Underlying Index does not reflect deductions for fees, expenses or taxes.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">PIMCO uses an indexing approach in managing the Fund's investments. The Fund employs a representative sampling strategy in seeking to achieve its investment objective. In using this strategy, PIMCO seeks to invest in a combination of Component Securities and other instruments such that the combination effectively provides exposure to the Underlying Index. In using a representative sampling strategy, the Fund may not track its Underlying Index with the same degree of accuracy as a fund that replicates the composition of the Underlying Index. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not attempt to outperform the index the Fund tracks. An indexing approach may eliminate the chance that the Fund will substantially outperform its Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs by keeping portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund may invest in derivative instruments, such as options, futures contracts or swap agreements, and may invest in mortgage related and other asset-backed securities. The Fund may invest in U.S. dollar-denominated securities of foreign issuers, including securities and instruments economically tied to emerging market countries. The Fund may purchase and sell securities on a when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment basis. The Fund may, without limitation, seek to obtain market exposure to the securities in which it primarily invests by entering into a series of purchase and sale contracts or by using other investment techniques (such as buy backs). The ""total return"" sought by the Fund consists of income earned on the Fund's investments, plus capital appreciation, if any, which generally arises from decreases in interest rates.</p>"

Strategy Narrative [Text Block],c_S000026749_BBBB,,,,,"<p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing under normal circumstances at least 80% of its total assets (exclusive of collateral held from securities lending) in the component securities (""Component Securities"") of The BofA Merrill Lynch 0-1 Year US Treasury Index℠ (the ""Underlying Index""). The Fund may invest the remainder of its assets in Fixed Income Instruments that are not Component Securities, but which PIMCO believes will help the Fund track its Underlying Index, as well as in cash and investment grade, liquid short-term instruments, forwards or derivatives, such as options, futures contracts or swap agreements, and shares of affiliated bond funds. ""Fixed Income Instruments"" include bonds, debt securities and other similar instruments issued by various U.S. and non-U.S. public- or private-sector entities. The average portfolio duration of this Fund will closely correspond to the portfolio duration of the securities comprising its Underlying Index, as calculated by PIMCO, which as of September 30, 2012 was 0.52 years. Duration is a measure used to determine the sensitivity of a security's price to changes in interest rates. The longer a security's duration, the more sensitive it will be to changes in interest rates.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Underlying Index is an unmanaged index comprised of U.S. dollar denominated sovereign debt securities publicly issued by the U.S. Treasury with maturities of less than 1 year. As of September 30, 2012, there were 37 issues in the Underlying Index. The securities in the Underlying Index have a minimum $1 billion of outstanding face value, have at least one month and less than one year remaining to maturity, are fixed-rate and are non-convertible. Bills, inflation-linked debt and strips are excluded from the Underlying Index; however, original issue zero coupon bonds are included in the Underlying Index and the amounts outstanding of qualifying coupon securities are not reduced by any portions that have been stripped. The Underlying Index is capitalization-weighted and the composition of Component Securities is updated monthly. Intra-month cash flows are reinvested daily, at the beginning-of-month 1-month Libid rate, until the end of the month at which point all cash is removed from the Underlying Index. It is not possible to invest directly in the Underlying Index. The Underlying Index does not reflect deductions for fees, expenses or taxes.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">PIMCO uses an indexing approach in managing the Fund's investments. The Fund employs a representative sampling strategy in seeking to achieve its investment objective. In using this strategy, PIMCO seeks to invest in a combination of Component Securities and other instruments such that the combination effectively provides exposure to the Underlying Index. In using a representative sampling strategy, the Fund may not track its Underlying Index with the same degree of accuracy as a fund that replicates the composition of the Underlying Index. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not attempt to outperform the index the Fund tracks. An indexing approach may eliminate the chance that the Fund will substantially outperform its Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs by keeping portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund may invest in derivative instruments, such as options, futures contracts or swap agreements. The Fund may purchase and sell securities on a when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment basis. The Fund may, without limitation, seek to obtain market exposure to the securities in which it primarily invests by entering into a series of purchase and sale contracts or by using other investment techniques (such as buy backs). The ""total return"" sought by the Fund consists of income earned on the Fund's investments, plus capital appreciation, if any, which generally arises from decreases in interest rates.</p>"

               <b>Market Trading Risk:</b> the risk that an active secondary trading market for Fund shares does not continue once developed, that the Fund may not continue to meet a listing exchange's trading or listing requirements, or that Fund shares trade at prices other than the Fund's net asset value</p>

The Fund incurs operating expenses, which are not applicable to the Underlying Index, and the costs of buying and selling securities, especially when rebalancing the Fund's portfolio to reflect changes in the composition of the Underlying Index. Performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary due to asset valuation differences and differences between the Fund's portfolio and the Underlying Index due to legal restrictions, cost or liquidity restraints.

As of September 30, 2012, there were 786 issues in the Underlying Index.

Country ratings are based on an average of Moody's, S&P and Fitch foreign currency long term sovereign debt ratings. For each issuer, the country of risk is the principal place of business derived from management location, country of primary listing, location of sales and reporting currency. In addition, qualifying securities must have a minimum $100 million of outstanding face value and a fixed coupon schedule. Original issue zero coupon bonds, debt issued simultaneously in the Eurobond and U.S. domestic bond markets, 144A securities and pay-in-kind securities qualify for inclusion in the Underlying Index. Callable perpetual securities qualify for inclusion in the Underlying Index provided they are at least one year from the first call date. Fixed-to-floating rate securities also qualify provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at least one year from last call prior to the date the bond transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security.

Strategy Narrative [Text Block],c_S000024822_BBBB,,,,,"<p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing under normal circumstances at least 80% of its total assets (exclusive of collateral held from securities lending) in the component securities (""Component Securities"") of The BofA Merrill Lynch 1-3 Year US Treasury Index℠ (the ""Underlying Index""). The Fund may invest the remainder of its assets in Fixed Income Instruments that are not Component Securities, but which PIMCO believes will help the Fund track its Underlying Index, as well as in cash and investment grade, liquid short-term instruments, forwards or derivatives, such as options, futures contracts or swap agreements, and shares of affiliated bond funds. ""Fixed Income Instruments"" include bonds, debt securities and other similar instruments issued by various U.S. and non-U.S. public- or private-sector entities. The average portfolio duration of this Fund will closely correspond to the portfolio duration of the securities comprising its Underlying Index, as calculated by PIMCO, which as of September 30, 2012 was 1.89 years. Duration is a measure used to determine the sensitivity of a security's price to changes in interest rates. The longer a security's duration, the more sensitive it will be to changes in interest rates.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Underlying Index is an unmanaged index comprised of U.S. dollar denominated sovereign debt securities publicly issued by the U.S. Treasury having a maturity of at least 1 year and less than 3 years. As of September 30, 2012, there were 70 issues in the Underlying Index. The securities in the Underlying Index have a minimum $1 billion of outstanding face value, have one to three years remaining to maturity, are fixed-rate and are non-convertible. Bills, inflation-indexed debt and strips are excluded from the Underlying Index; however, original issue zero coupon bonds are included in the Underlying Index and the amounts outstanding of qualifying coupon securities are not reduced by any portions that have been stripped. The Underlying Index is capitalization-weighted and the composition of Component Securities is updated monthly. It is not possible to invest directly in the Underlying Index. Intra-month cash flows are reinvested daily, at the beginning-of-month 1-month Libid rate, until the end of the month at which point all cash is removed from the Underlying Index. The Underlying Index does not reflect deductions for fees, expenses or taxes.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">PIMCO uses an indexing approach in managing the Fund's investments. The Fund employs a representative sampling strategy in seeking to achieve its investment objective. In using this strategy, PIMCO seeks to invest in a combination of Component Securities and other instruments such that the combination effectively provides exposure to the Underlying Index. In using a representative sampling strategy, the Fund may not track its Underlying Index with the same degree of accuracy as a fund that replicates the composition of the Underlying Index. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not attempt to outperform the index the Fund tracks. An indexing approach may eliminate the chance that the Fund will substantially outperform its Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs by keeping portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund may invest in derivative instruments, such as options, futures contracts or swap agreements. The Fund may purchase and sell securities on a when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment basis. The Fund may, without limitation, seek to obtain market exposure to the securities in which it primarily invests by entering into a series of purchase and sale contracts or by using other investment techniques (such as buy backs). The ""total return"" sought by the Fund consists of income earned on the Fund's investments, plus capital appreciation, if any, which generally arises from decreases in interest rates.</p>"

The Fund may invest the remainder of its assets in Fixed Income Instruments that are not Component Securities, but which Pacific Investment Management Company LLC (""PIMCO"") believes will help the Fund track its Underlying Index, as well as in cash and investment grade, liquid short-term instruments, forwards or derivatives, such as options, futures contracts or swap agreements, and shares of affiliated bond funds. ""Fixed Income Instruments"" include bonds, debt securities and other similar instruments issued by various U.S. and non-U.S. public- or private-sector entities. The dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity of this Fund will closely correspond to the average maturity of its Underlying Index, which as of September 30, 2012 was 3.10 years.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Underlying Index is an unmanaged index comprised of TIPS (Treasury Inflation Protected Securities) with a maturity of at least 1 year and less than 5 years. TIPS are publicly issued, dollar denominated U.S. Government securities issued by the U.S. Treasury that have principal and interest payments linked to official inflation (as measured by the Consumer Price Index, or CPI). Their payments are supported by the full faith and credit of the United States. The TIPS in the Underlying Index have a minimum $1 billion of outstanding face value, have 1 to 5 years remaining to maturity and have interest and principal payments tied to inflation. Original issue zero coupon bonds can be included in the Underlying Index and the amounts outstanding of qualifying coupon securities are not reduced by any portions that have been stripped. As of September 30, 2012, there were 12 TIPS issues in the Underlying Index. The Underlying Index is capitalization-weighted and the composition of TIPS is updated monthly. Intra-month cash flows are reinvested daily, at the beginning-of-month 1-month Libid rate, until the end of the month at which point all cash is removed from the Underlying Index. It is not possible to invest directly in the Underlying Index. The Underlying Index does not reflect deductions for fees, expenses or taxes.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">PIMCO uses an indexing approach in managing the Fund's investments. The Fund employs a representative sampling strategy in seeking to achieve its investment objective. In using this strategy, PIMCO seeks to invest in a combination of Component Securities and other instruments such that the combination effectively provides exposure to the Underlying Index. In using a representative sampling strategy, the Fund may not track its Underlying Index with the same degree of accuracy as a fund that replicates the composition of the Underlying Index. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not attempt to outperform the index the Fund tracks. An indexing approach may eliminate the chance that the Fund will substantially outperform its Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs by keeping portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</p>

The Fund may, without limitation, seek to obtain market exposure to the securities in which it primarily invests by entering into a series of purchase and sale contracts or by using other investment techniques (such as buy backs). The ""total return"" sought by the Fund consists of income earned on the Fund's investments, plus capital appreciation, if any, which generally arises from decreases in real interest rates and in the case of inflation-linked bonds, increased inflation.</p>"

               <b>Management and Tracking Error Risk:</b> the risk that the portfolio manager's investment decisions may not produce the desired results or that the Fund's portfolio may not closely track the Underlying Index for a number of reasons. The Fund incurs operating expenses, which are not applicable to the Underlying Index, and the costs of buying and selling securities, especially when rebalancing the Fund's portfolio to reflect changes in the composition of the Underlying Index. Performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary due to asset valuation differences and differences between the Fund's portfolio and the Underlying Index due to legal restrictions, cost or liquidity restraints.

Strategy Narrative [Text Block],c_S000026750_BBBB,,,,,"<p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing under normal circumstances at least 80% of its total assets (exclusive of collateral held from securities lending) in the component securities (""Component Securities"") of The BofA Merrill Lynch Long US Treasury Principal STRIPS Index℠ (the ""Underlying Index""). The Fund may invest the remainder of its assets in Fixed Income Instruments that are not Component Securities, but which Pacific Investment Management Company LLC (""PIMCO"") believes will help the Fund track its Underlying Index, as well as in cash and investment grade, liquid short-term instruments, forwards or derivatives, such as options, futures contracts or swap agreements, and shares of affiliated bond funds. ""Fixed Income Instruments"" include bonds, debt securities and other similar instruments issued by various U.S. and non-U.S. public- or private-sector entities. The average portfolio duration of this Fund will closely correspond to the portfolio duration of the securities comprising its Underlying Index, as calculated by PIMCO, which as of September 30, 2012 was 30.13 years. Duration is a measure used to determine the sensitivity of a security's price to changes in interest rates. The longer a security's duration, the more sensitive it will be to changes in interest rates.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Underlying Index is an unmanaged index comprised of long maturity Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities (""STRIPS"") representing the final principal payment of U.S. Treasury bonds. The principal STRIPS comprising the Underlying Index must have 25 years or more remaining term to final maturity and must be stripped from U.S. Treasury bonds having at least $1 billion in outstanding face value. As of September 30, 2012, there were 17 issues in the Underlying Index. Index constituents are capitalization-weighted based on the security prices times an assumed face value of $1 billion per constituent security. The Underlying Index is rebalanced quarterly on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, based on information available up to and including the third business day before the last business day of the rebalancing month. Securities that no longer meet the qualifying criteria during the course of the quarter remain in the Underlying Index until the next quarterly rebalancing date at which point they are dropped from the Underlying Index. It is not possible to invest directly in the Underlying Index. The Underlying Index does not reflect deductions for fees, expenses or taxes.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">PIMCO uses an indexing approach in managing the Fund's investments. The Fund employs a representative sampling strategy in seeking to achieve its investment objective. In using this strategy, PIMCO seeks to invest in a combination of Component Securities and other instruments such that the combination effectively provides exposure to the Underlying Index. In using a representative sampling strategy, the Fund may not track its Underlying Index with the same degree of accuracy as a fund that replicates the composition of the Underlying Index. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not attempt to outperform the index the Fund tracks. An indexing approach may eliminate the chance that the Fund will substantially outperform its Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs by keeping portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund may invest in derivative instruments, such as options, futures contracts or swap agreements. The Fund may purchase and sell securities on a when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment basis. The Fund may, without limitation, seek to obtain market exposure to the securities in which it primarily invests by entering into a series of purchase and sale contracts or by using other investment techniques (such as buy backs). The ""total return"" sought by the Fund consists of income earned on the Fund's investments, plus capital appreciation, if any, which generally arises from decreases in interest rates.</p>"

The Fund may invest the remainder of its assets in Fixed Income Instruments that are not Component Securities, but which Pacific Investment Management Company LLC (""PIMCO"") believes will help the Fund track its Underlying Index, as well as in cash and investment grade, liquid short-term instruments, forwards or derivatives, such as options, futures contracts or swap agreements, and shares of affiliated bond funds. ""Fixed Income Instruments"" include bonds, debt securities and other similar instruments issued by various U.S. and non-U.S. public- or private-sector entities. The average portfolio duration of this Fund will closely correspond to the portfolio duration of the securities comprising its Underlying Index, as calculated by PIMCO, which as of September 30, 2012 was 4.59 years. Duration is a measure used to determine the sensitivity of a security's price to changes in interest rates. The longer a security's duration, the more sensitive it will be to changes in interest rates.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Underlying Index is an unmanaged index comprised of U.S. dollar denominated sovereign debt securities publicly issued by the U.S. Treasury having a maturity of at least 3 years and less than 7 years. As of September 30, 2012, there were 93 issues in the Underlying Index. The securities in the Underlying Index have a minimum $1 billion of outstanding face value, have 3 to 7 years remaining to maturity, are fixed-rate and are non-convertible. Bills, inflation-linked debt and strips are excluded from the Underlying Index; however, original issue zero coupon bonds are included in the Underlying Index and the amounts outstanding of qualifying coupon securities are not reduced by any portions that have been stripped. The Underlying Index is capitalization-weighted and the composition of Component Securities is updated monthly. Intra-month cash flows are reinvested daily, at the beginning-of-month 1-month Libid rate, until the end of the month at which point all cash is removed from the Underlying Index. It is not possible to invest directly in the Underlying Index. The Underlying Index does not reflect deductions for fees, expenses or taxes.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">PIMCO uses an indexing approach in managing the Fund's investments. The Fund employs a representative sampling strategy in seeking to achieve its investment objective. In using this strategy, PIMCO seeks to invest in a combination of Component Securities and other instruments such that the combination effectively provides exposure to the Underlying Index. In using a representative sampling strategy, the Fund may not track its Underlying Index with the same degree of accuracy as a fund that replicates the composition of the Underlying Index. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not attempt to outperform the index the Fund tracks. An indexing approach may eliminate the chance that the Fund will substantially outperform its Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs by keeping portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</p>

            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Market Trading Risk:</b> the risk that an active secondary trading market for Fund shares does not continue once developed, that the Fund may not continue to meet a listing exchange's trading or listing requirements, or that Fund shares trade at prices other than the Fund's net asset value</p>

            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">

               <b>Derivatives Risk:</b> the risk of investing in derivative instruments, including liquidity, interest rate, market, credit and management risks, mispricing or improper valuation. Changes in the value of the derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying asset, rate or index, and the Fund could lose more than the principal amount invested</p>

               <b>Leveraging Risk:</b> the risk that certain transactions of the Fund, such as reverse repurchase agreements, loans of portfolio securities, and the use of when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment transactions, or derivative instruments, may give rise to leverage, causing the Fund to be more volatile than if it had not been leveraged</p>

               <b>Management and Tracking Error Risk:</b> the risk that the portfolio manager's investment decisions may not produce the desired results or that the Fund's portfolio may not closely track the Underlying Index for a number of reasons. The Fund incurs operating expenses, which are not applicable to the Underlying Index, and the costs of buying and selling securities, especially when rebalancing the Fund's portfolio to reflect changes in the composition of the Underlying Index. Performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary due to asset valuation differences and differences between the Fund's portfolio and the Underlying Index due to legal restrictions, cost or liquidity restraints. In addition, the Fund's use of a representative sampling approach may cause the Fund to be less correlated to the return of the Underlying Index than if the Fund held all of the securities in the Underlying Index</p>

               <b>Market Risk:</b> the risk that the value of securities owned by the Fund may go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably, due to factors affecting securities markets generally or particular sectors</p>

               <b>Liquidity Risk:</b> the risk that a particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell and that the Fund may be unable to sell illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price or achieve its desired level of exposure to a certain sector</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Derivatives Risk:</b> the risk of investing in derivative instruments, including liquidity, interest rate, market, credit and management risks, mispricing or improper valuation. Changes in the value of the derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying asset, rate or index, and the Fund could lose more than the principal amount invested</p>

               <b>Leveraging Risk:</b> the risk that certain transactions of the Fund, such as reverse repurchase agreements, loans of portfolio securities, and the use of when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment transactions, or derivative instruments, may give rise to leverage, causing the Fund to be more volatile than if it had not been leveraged</p>

               <b>Management and Tracking Error Risk:</b> the risk that the portfolio manager's investment decisions may not produce the desired results or that the Fund's portfolio may not closely track the Underlying Index for a number of reasons. The Fund incurs operating expenses, which are not applicable to the Underlying Index, and the costs of buying and selling securities, especially when rebalancing the Fund's portfolio to reflect changes in the composition of the Underlying Index. Performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary due to asset valuation differences and differences between the Fund's portfolio and the Underlying Index due to legal restrictions, cost or liquidity restraints. In addition, the Fund's use of a representative sampling approach may cause the Fund to be less correlated to the return of the Underlying Index than if the Fund held all of the securities in the Underlying Index</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
