Risk Narrative,v_ETF_S000030012,,,,,"<p>An investment in the Fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the Fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The Fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the Fund's performance:</p><p>Stock market risk, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The Fund's target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies, which could cause the Fund to underperform the overall stock market.</p><p>Investment style risk, which is the chance that returns from large-capitalization growth stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Large-cap growth stocks tend to go through cycles of doing better-or worse-than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general.

Although it is expected that the market price of an S&#38;P 500 Growth ETF Share typically will approximate its net asset value (NAV), there may be times when the market price and the NAV differ significantly. Thus, you may pay more or less than NAV when you buy S&#38;P 500 Growth ETF Shares on the secondary market, and you may receive more or less than NAV when you sell those shares.</p><p>Although S&#38;P 500 Growth ETF Shares are listed for trading on NYSE Arca, it is possible that an active trading market may not be maintained.</p><p>Trading of S&#38;P 500 Growth ETF Shares on NYSE Arca may be halted by the activation of individual or marketwide 'circuit breakers' (which halt trading for a specific period of time when the price of a particular security or overall market prices decline by a specified percentage). Trading of S&#38;P 500 Growth ETF Shares may also be halted if (1) the shares are delisted from NYSE Arca without first being listed on another exchange or (2) NYSE Arca officials determine that such action is appropriate in the interest of a fair and orderly market or to protect investors.</p><p>An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.</p>"

Risk Narrative,v_ETF_S000030013,,,,,"<p>An investment in the Fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the Fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The Fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the Fund's performance:</p><p>Stock market risk, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The Fund's target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies, which could cause the Fund to underperform the overall stock market.</p><p>Investment style risk, which is the chance that returns from large-capitalization value stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Large-cap value stocks tend to go through cycles of doing better-or worse-than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years.</p><p>Because ETF Shares are traded on an exchange, they are subject to additional risks:</p><p>S&#38;P 500 Value ETF Shares are listed for trading on NYSE Arca and are bought and sold on the secondary market at market prices. Although it is expected that the market price of an S&#38;P 500 Value ETF Share typically will approximate its net asset value (NAV), there may be times when the market price and the NAV differ significantly. Thus, you may pay more or less than NAV when you buy S&#38;P 500 Value ETF Shares on the secondary market, and you may receive more or less than NAV when you sell those shares.</p><p>Although S&#38;P 500 Value ETF Shares are listed for trading on NYSE Arca, it is possible that an active trading market may not be maintained.</p><p>Trading of S&#38;P 500 Value ETF Shares on NYSE Arca may be halted by the activation of individual or marketwide 'circuit breakers' (which halt trading for a specific period of time when the price of a particular security or overall market prices decline by a specified percentage). Trading of S&#38;P 500 Value ETF Shares may also be halted if (1) the shares are delisted from NYSE Arca without first being listed on another exchange or (2) NYSE Arca officials determine that such action is appropriate in the interest of a fair and orderly market or to protect investors.</p><p>An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.</p>"

Bar Chart Narrative,v_Institutional_S000030017,,,,,"<p>The following bar chart and table are intended to help you understand the risks of investing in the Fund. Because there is no calendar-year performance information for the Fund's Institutional Shares, the information presented in the bar chart and table reflects the performance of the ETF Shares of Vanguard S&#38;P Small-Cap 600 Index. (ETF Shares are offered through a separate prospectus.) Performance based on net asset value for the Institutional Shares would be substantially similar because both share classes constitute an investment in the same portfolio of securities; their returns generally should differ only to the extent that the expenses of the two classes differ. The bar chart shows the performance of the Fund's ETF Shares (based on NAV) in their first full calendar year. The table shows how the average annual total returns of the ETF Shares compare with those of the Fund's target index. Keep in mind that the Fund's past performance (before and after taxes) does not indicate how the Fund will perform in the future.

Fees and Expenses of the Fund,v_Institutional_S000030017,,,,,"<p>The following table describes the fees and expenses you may pay if you buy and hold Institutional Shares of the Fund.
