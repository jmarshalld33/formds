Bar Chart Narrative,v_ETF_S000005786,,,,,<p>The following bar chart and table are intended to help you understand the risks of investing in the Fund. The bar chart shows how the performance of the Fund's ETF Shares (based on NAV) has varied from one calendar year to another over the periods shown. The table shows how the average annual total returns of the ETF Shares compare with those of a relevant market index and another comparative index. MSCI Emerging Markets Index returns are adjusted for withholding taxes. Keep in mind that the Fund's past performance (before and after taxes) does not indicate how the Fund will perform in the future.

It illustrates the hypothetical expenses that you would incur over various periods if you invest $10,000 in FTSE Emerging Markets ETF. This example assumes that FTSE Emerging Markets ETF provides a return of 5% a year and that total annual fund operating expenses remain as stated in the preceding table.

Investment objective,v_ETF_S000005786,,,,,<p>The Fund seeks to track the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of stocks issued by companies located in emerging market countries.</p>
Performance Table Closing,v_ETF_S000005786,,,,,"<p>Actual after-tax returns depend on your tax situation and may differ from those shown in the preceding table. When after-tax returns are calculated, it is assumed that the shareholder was in the highest individual federal marginal income tax bracket at the time of each distribution of income or capital gains or upon redemption. State and local income taxes are not reflected in the calculations. Please note that after-tax returns are not relevant for a shareholder who holds fund shares in a tax-deferred account, such as an individual retirement account or a 401(k) plan. Also, figures captioned Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of Fund Shares will be higher than other figures for the same period if a capital loss occurs upon redemption and results in an assumed tax deduction for the shareholder.</p>"

Portfolio Turnover,v_ETF_S000005786,,,,,"<p>The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or 'turns over' its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in more taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the previous expense example, reduce the Fund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 8%.

May Lose Money,v_ETF_S000005786,,,,,<p>An investment in the Fund could lose money over short or even long periods. </p>
Risk Narrative,v_ETF_S000005786,,,,,"<p>An investment in the Fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the Fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The Fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the Fund's performance:</p><p>Stock market risk, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The Fund's investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks have, at times, moved in opposite directions. In addition, the Fund's target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies.</p><p>Emerging markets risk, which is the chance that the stocks of companies located in emerging markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the stocks of companies located in more developed foreign markets.</p><p>Country/regional risk, which is the chance that world events-such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters-will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. The Index's, and therefore the Fund's, heavy exposure to China, Brazil, and Taiwan subjects the Fund to a higher degree of country risk than that of more geographically diversified international funds.</p><p>Currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Currency risk is especially high in emerging markets.</p><p>Index sampling risk, which is the chance that the securities selected for the Fund, in the aggregate, will not provide investment performance matching that of the Fund's target index. Index sampling risk for the Fund should be low.</p><p>Because ETF Shares are traded on an exchange, they are subject to additional risks:</p><p>FTSE Emerging Markets ETF Shares are listed for trading on NYSE Arca and are bought and sold on the secondary market at market prices. Although it is expected that the market price of a FTSE Emerging Markets ETF Share typically will approximate its NAV, there may be times when the market price and the NAV differ significantly. Thus, you may pay more or less than NAV when you buy FTSE Emerging Markets ETF Shares on the secondary market, and you may receive more or less than NAV when you sell those shares.</p><p>Although FTSE Emerging Markets ETF Shares are listed for trading on NYSE Arca, it is possible that an active trading market may not be maintained.</p><p>Trading of FTSE Emerging Markets ETF Shares on NYSE Arca may be halted by the activation of individual or marketwide 'circuit breakers' (which halt trading for a specific period of time when the price of a particular security or overall market prices decline by a specified percentage). Trading of FTSE Emerging Markets ETF Shares may also be halted if (1) the shares are delisted from NYSE Arca without first being listed on another exchange or (2) NYSE Arca officials determine that such action is appropriate in the interest of a fair and orderly market or to protect investors.</p><p>An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.</p>"

The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks have, at times, moved in opposite directions. In addition, the Fund's target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies.</p><p>Emerging markets risk, which is the chance that the stocks of companies located in emerging markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the stocks of companies located in more developed foreign markets.</p><p>Country/regional risk, which is the chance that world events-such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters-will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. The Index's, and therefore the Fund's, heavy exposure to China, Brazil, and Taiwan subjects the Fund to a higher degree of country risk than that of more geographically diversified international funds.</p><p>Currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.

Risk Narrative,v_ETF_S000005787,,,,,"<p>An investment in the Fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the Fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The Fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the Fund's performance:</p><p>Stock market risk, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The Fund's investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks have, at times, moved in opposite directions. In addition, the Fund's target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies.</p><p>Country/regional risk, which is the chance that world events-such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters-will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. The Index's, and therefore the Fund's, heavy exposure to four countries (the United Kingdom, France, Switzerland, and Germany) subjects the Fund to a higher degree of country risk than that of more geographically diversified international funds.</p><p>Currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.  </p><p>Because ETF Shares are traded on an exchange, they are subject to additional risks:</p><p>MSCI Europe ETF Shares are listed for trading on NYSE Arca and are bought and sold on the secondary market at market prices. Although it is expected that the market price of an MSCI Europe ETF Share typically will approximate its net asset value (NAV), there may be times when the market price and the NAV differ significantly. Thus, you may pay more or less than NAV when you buy MSCI Europe ETF Shares on the secondary market, and you may receive more or less than NAV when you sell those shares.</p><p>Although MSCI Europe ETF Shares are listed for trading on NYSE Arca, it is possible that an active trading market may not be maintained.</p><p>Trading of MSCI Europe ETF Shares on NYSE Arca may be halted by the activation of individual or marketwide 'circuit breakers' (which halt trading for a specific period of time when the price of a particular security or overall market prices decline by a specified percentage). Trading of MSCI Europe ETF Shares may also be halted if (1) the shares are delisted from NYSE Arca without first being listed on another exchange or (2) NYSE Arca officials determine that such action is appropriate in the interest of a fair and orderly market or to protect investors.</p><p>An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.</p>"

This example assumes that FTSE All-World ex-US ETF provides a return of 5% a year and that total annual fund operating expenses remain as stated in the preceding table.

May Lose Money,v_ETF_S000015871,,,,,<p>An investment in the Fund could lose money over short or even long periods. </p>
Risk Narrative,v_ETF_S000015871,,,,,"<p>An investment in the Fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the Fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of global stock markets. The Fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the Fund's performance:</p><p>Stock market risk, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The Fund's investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks have, at times, moved in opposite directions. In addition, the Fund's target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies.</p><p>Country/regional risk, which is the chance that world events-such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters-will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the Fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in any one country or region,  the Fund's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.</p><p>Emerging markets risk, which is the chance that the stocks of companies located in emerging markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the stocks of companies located in more developed foreign markets.</p><p>Currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Currency risk is especially high in emerging markets.</p><p>Because ETF Shares are traded on an exchange, they are subject to additional risks:</p><p>FTSE All-World ex-US ETF Shares are listed for trading on NYSE Arca and are bought and sold on the secondary market at market prices. Although it is expected that the market price of a FTSE All-World ex-US ETF Share typically will approximate its net asset value (NAV), there may be times when the market price and the NAV differ significantly. Thus, you may pay more or less than NAV when you buy FTSE All-World ex-US ETF Shares on the secondary market, and you may receive more or less than NAV when you sell those shares.</p><p>Although FTSE All-World ex-US ETF Shares are listed for trading on NYSE Arca, it is possible that an active trading market may not be maintained.</p><p>Trading of FTSE All-World ex-US ETF Shares on NYSE Arca may be halted by the activation of individual or marketwide 'circuit breakers' (which halt trading for a specific period of time when the price of a particular security or overall market prices decline by a specified percentage). Trading of FTSE All-World ex-US ETF Shares may also be halted if (1) the shares are delisted from NYSE Arca without first being listed on another exchange or (2) NYSE Arca officials determine that such action is appropriate in the interest of a fair and orderly market or to protect investors.</p><p>An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.</p>"

The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks have, at times, moved in opposite directions. In addition, the Fund's target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies.</p><p>Country/regional risk, which is the chance that world events-such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters-will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the Fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in any one country or region,  the Fund's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.</p><p>Emerging markets risk, which is the chance that the stocks of companies located in emerging markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the stocks of companies located in more developed foreign markets.</p><p>Currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.

It illustrates the hypothetical expenses that you would incur over various periods if you invest $10,000 in FTSE All-World ex-US Small-Cap ETF. This example assumes that FTSE All-World ex-US Small-Cap ETF provides a return of 5% a year and that total annual fund operating expenses remain as stated in the preceding table.

May Lose Money,v_ETF_S000025074,,,,,<p>An investment in the Fund could lose money over short or even long periods. </p>
Risk Narrative,v_ETF_S000025074,,,,,"<p>An investment in the Fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the Fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of global stock markets. The Fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the Fund's performance:</p><p>Stock market risk, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The Fund's investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks have, at times, moved in opposite directions. In addition, the Fund's target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies.</p><p>Country/regional risk, which is the chance that world events-such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters-will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the Fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in any one country or region,  the Fund's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.</p><p>Emerging markets risk, which is the chance that the stocks of companies located in emerging markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the stocks of companies located in more developed foreign markets.</p><p>Currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Currency risk is especially high in emerging markets.</p><p>Index sampling risk, which is the chance that the securities selected for the Fund, in the aggregate, will not provide investment performance matching that of the Fund's target index. Index sampling risk for the Fund should be low.</p><p>Investment style risk, which is the chance that returns from non-U.S. small-capitalization stocks will trail returns from global stock markets. Historically, non-U.S. small-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the global markets, and they often perform quite differently.</p><p>Because ETF Shares are traded on an exchange, they are subject to additional risks:</p><p>FTSE All-World ex-US Small-Cap ETF Shares are listed for trading on NYSE Arca and are bought and sold on the secondary market at market prices. Although it is expected that the market price of a FTSE All-World ex-US Small-Cap ETF Share typically will approximate its net asset value (NAV), there may be times when the market price and the NAV differ significantly. Thus, you may pay more or less than NAV when you buy FTSE All-World ex-US Small-Cap ETF Shares on the secondary market, and you may receive more or less than NAV when you sell those shares.</p><p>Although FTSE All-World ex-US Small-Cap ETF Shares are listed for trading on NYSE Arca, it is possible that an active trading market may not be maintained.</p><p>Trading of FTSE All-World ex-US Small-Cap ETF Shares on NYSE Arca may be halted by the activation of individual or marketwide 'circuit breakers' (which halt trading for a specific period of time when the price of a particular security or overall market prices decline by a specified percentage). Trading of FTSE All-World ex-US Small-Cap ETF Shares may also be halted if (1) the shares are delisted from NYSE Arca without first being listed on another exchange or (2) NYSE Arca officials determine that such action is appropriate in the interest of a fair and orderly market or to protect investors.</p><p>An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.</p>"

Currency risk is especially high in emerging markets.</p><p>Index sampling risk, which is the chance that the securities selected for the Fund, in the aggregate, will not provide investment performance matching that of the Fund's target index. Index sampling risk for the Fund should be low.</p><p>Investment style risk, which is the chance that returns from non-U.S. small-capitalization stocks will trail returns from global stock markets. Historically, non-U.S. small-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the global markets, and they often perform quite differently.</p><p>An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.</p>"
StrategyNarrative,v_Retail_S000025074,,,,,"<p>The Fund employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the performance of the FTSE Global Small Cap ex US Index, a free-float-adjusted, market-capitalization-weighted index designed to measure equity market performance of international small-capitalization stocks. The Index includes approximately 3,050 stocks of companies located in 46 countries, including both developed and emerging markets. As of October 31, 2012, the largest markets covered in the Index were Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, Taiwan, and Australia (which made up approximately 17%, 16%, 12%, 6%, and 6%, respectively, of the Index's market capitalization). The Fund attempts to sample the target index by investing all, or substantially all, of its assets in common stocks in the Index and by holding a representative sample of securities that resembles the full Index in terms of key risk factors and other characteristics. These factors include industry ratings, country ratings, market capitalization, and other financial characteristics of stocks.</p>"

Performance Table Closing,v_ETF_S000030007,,,,,"<p>Actual after-tax returns depend on your tax situation and may differ from those shown in the preceding table.

State and local income taxes are not reflected in the calculations. Please note that after-tax returns are not relevant for a shareholder who holds fund shares in a tax-deferred account, such as an individual retirement account or a 401(k) plan.

Portfolio Turnover Heading,v_ETF_S000030007,,,,,<p>Portfolio Turnover</p>
Portfolio Turnover,v_ETF_S000030007,,,,,"<p>The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or 'turns over' its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in more taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the previous expense example, reduce the Fund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 10%. </p>"
May Lose Money,v_ETF_S000030007,,,,,<p>An investment in the Fund could lose money over short or even long periods. </p>
Risk Narrative,v_ETF_S000030007,,,,,"<p>An investment in the Fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the Fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of global stock markets. The Fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the Fund's performance:</p><p>Industry concentration risk, which is the chance that real estate stocks will decline because of adverse developments affecting the real estate industry and real property values. Because the Fund concentrates its assets in real estate stocks, industry concentration risk is high. The real estate industry can be adversely affected by, among other things, the value of securities of issuers in the real estate industry, including REITs and REMDs, and changes in real estate values and rental income, property taxes, interest rates, and demographics.</p><p>Investment style risk, which is the chance that returns from real estate securities-which frequently are small- or mid-capitalization stocks-will trail returns from global stock markets. Historically, real estate securities have performed quite differently from the global stock markets.</p><p>Nondiversification risk, which is the chance that the Fund's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks or even a single stock. The Fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of particular issuers as compared with other mutual funds.</p><p>Stock market risk, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The Fund's investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks have, at times, moved in opposite directions.</p><p>Country/regional risk, which is the chance that world events-such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters-will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the Fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in any one country or region, including emerging markets, the Fund's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.</p><p>Currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Currency risk is especially high in emerging markets.</p><p>Because ETF Shares are traded on an exchange, they are subject to additional risks:</p><p>Global ex-U.S. Real Estate ETF Shares are listed for trading on Nasdaq and are bought and sold on the secondary market at market prices. Although it is expected that the market price of a Global ex-U.S. Real Estate ETF Share typically will approximate its net asset value (NAV), there may be times when the market price and the NAV differ significantly. Thus, you may pay more or less than NAV when you buy Global ex-U.S. Real Estate ETF Shares on the secondary market, and you may receive more or less than NAV when you sell those shares.</p><p>Although Global ex-U.S. Real Estate ETF Shares are listed for trading on Nasdaq, it is possible that an active trading market may not be maintained.</p><p>Trading of Global ex-U.S. Real Estate ETF Shares on Nasdaq may be halted by the activation of individual or marketwide 'circuit breakers' (which halt trading for a specific period of time when the price of a particular security or overall market prices decline by a specified percentage). Trading of Global ex-U.S. Real Estate ETF Shares may also be halted if (1) the shares are delisted from Nasdaq without first being listed on another exchange or (2) Nasdaq officials determine that such action is appropriate in the interest of a fair and orderly market or to protect investors.</p><p>An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.</p>"

The Index is composed of stocks of publicly traded equity real estate investment trusts (known as REITs) and certain real estate management and development companies (REMDs).

They illustrate the hypothetical expenses that you would incur over various periods if you invest $10,000 in the Fund's shares. The first example assumes that the Shares provide a return of 5% a year, that total annual fund operating expenses remain as stated in the preceding table, and that you redeem your shares at the end of the given period.

Risk Narrative,v_Institutional_S000030007,,,,,"<p>An investment in the Fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the Fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of global stock markets. The Fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the Fund's performance:</p><p>Industry concentration risk, which is the chance that real estate stocks will decline because of adverse developments affecting the real estate industry and real property values. Because the Fund concentrates its assets in real estate stocks, industry concentration risk is high. The real estate industry can be adversely affected by, among other things, the value of securities of issuers in the real estate industry, including REITs and REMDs, and changes in real estate values and rental income, property taxes, interest rates, and demographics.</p><p>Investment style risk, which is the chance that returns from real estate securities-which frequently are small- or mid-capitalization stocks-will trail returns from global stock markets. Historically, real estate securities have performed quite differently from the global stock markets.</p><p>Nondiversification risk, which is the chance that the Fund's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks or even a single stock. The Fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of particular issuers as compared with other mutual funds.</p><p>Stock market risk, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. In addition, investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks have, at times, moved in opposite directions. </p><p>Country/regional risk, which is the chance that world events-such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters-will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the Fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in any one country or region, including emerging markets, the Fund's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.</p><p>Currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Currency risk is especially high in emerging markets.</p><p>An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.</p>"

"Expense Example, Narrative [Text Block]",v_Signal_S000030007,,,,,"<p>The following examples are intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund's Signal Shares with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. They illustrate the hypothetical expenses that you would incur over various periods if you invest $10,000 in the Fund's shares. The first example assumes that the Shares provide a return of 5% a year, that total annual fund operating expenses remain as stated in the preceding table, and that you redeem your shares at the end of the given period. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:</p>"
Fees and Expenses of the Fund,v_Signal_S000030007,,,,,<p>The following table describes the fees and expenses you may pay if you buy and hold Signal Shares of the Fund.</p>
Investment objective,v_Signal_S000030007,,,,,<p>The Fund seeks to track the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of international real estate stocks.</p>
Performance Table Closing,v_Signal_S000030007,,,,,"<p>Actual after-tax returns depend on your tax situation and may differ from those shown in the preceding table. When after-tax returns are calculated, it is assumed that the shareholder was in the highest individual federal marginal income tax bracket at the time of each distribution of income or capital gains or upon redemption. State and local income taxes are not reflected in the calculations. Please note that after-tax returns are not relevant for a shareholder who holds fund shares in a tax-deferred account, such as an individual retirement account or a 401(k) plan. Also, figures captioned Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of Fund Shares will be higher than other figures for the same period if a capital loss occurs upon redemption and results in an assumed tax deduction for the shareholder.</p>"
Portfolio Turnover Heading,v_Signal_S000030007,,,,,<p>Portfolio Turnover</p>
Portfolio Turnover,v_Signal_S000030007,,,,,"<p>The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or 'turns over' its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in more taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the previous expense examples, reduce the Fund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 10%. </p>"
May Lose Money,v_Signal_S000030007,,,,,<p>An investment in the Fund could lose money over short or even long periods. </p>
Risk Narrative,v_Signal_S000030007,,,,,"<p>An investment in the Fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the Fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of global stock markets. The Fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the Fund's performance:</p><p>Industry concentration risk, which is the chance that real estate stocks will decline because of adverse developments affecting the real estate industry and real property values. Because the Fund concentrates its assets in real estate stocks, industry concentration risk is high. The real estate industry can be adversely affected by, among other things, the value of securities of issuers in the real estate industry, including REITs and REMDs, and changes in real estate values and rental income, property taxes, interest rates, and demographics.</p><p>Investment style risk, which is the chance that returns from real estate securities-which frequently are small- or mid-capitalization stocks-will trail returns from global stock markets. Historically, real estate securities have performed quite differently from the global stock markets.</p><p>Nondiversification risk, which is the chance that the Fund's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks or even a single stock. The Fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of particular issuers as compared with other mutual funds.</p><p>Stock market risk, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The Fund's investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks have, at times, moved in opposite directions.</p><p>Country/regional risk, which is the chance that world events-such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters-will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the Fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in any one country or region, including emerging markets, the Fund's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.</p><p>Currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Currency risk is especially high in emerging markets.</p><p>An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.</p>"
StrategyNarrative,v_Signal_S000030007,,,,,"<p>The Fund employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the performance of the S&#38;P Global ex-U.S. Property Index, a free-float-adjusted, market-capitalization-weighted index that measures the equity market performance of international real estate stocks in both developed and emerging markets. The Index is composed of stocks of publicly traded equity real estate investment trusts (known as REITs) and certain real estate management and development companies (REMDs). The Fund attempts to replicate the Index by investing all, or substantially all, of its assets in the stocks that make up the Index, holding each stock in approximately the same proportion as its weighting in the Index.</p>"

Risk Narrative,v_ETF_S000005788,,,,,"<p>An investment in the Fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the Fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The Fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the Fund's performance:</p><p>Stock market risk, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The Fund's investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks have, at times, moved in opposite directions. In addition, the Fund's target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies.</p><p>Country/regional risk, which is the chance that world events-such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters-will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. The Index's, and therefore the Fund's, heavy exposure to Japan and Australia subjects the Fund to a higher degree of country risk than that of more geographically diversified international funds.</p><p>Currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.  </p><p>Because ETF Shares are traded on an exchange, they are subject to additional risks:</p><p> MSCI Pacific ETF Shares are listed for trading on NYSE Arca and are bought and sold on the secondary market at market prices. Although it is expected that the market price of an MSCI Pacific ETF Share typically will approximate its NAV, there may be times when the market price and the NAV differ significantly. Thus, you may pay more or less than NAV when you buy MSCI Pacific ETF Shares on the secondary market, and you may receive more or less than NAV when you sell those shares.</p><p>Although MSCI Pacific ETF Shares are listed for trading on NYSE Arca, it is possible that an active trading market may not be maintained.</p><p>Trading of MSCI Pacific Shares on NYSE Arca may be halted by the activation of individual or marketwide 'circuit breakers' (which halt trading for a specific period of time when the price of a particular security or overall market prices decline by a specified percentage). Trading of MSCI Pacific ETF Shares may also be halted if (1) the shares are delisted from NYSE Arca without first being listed on another exchange or (2) NYSE Arca officials determine that such action is appropriate in the interest of a fair and orderly market or to protect investors.</p><p>An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.</p>"

The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks have, at times, moved in opposite directions. In addition, the Fund's target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies.</p><p>Investment style risk, which is the chance that returns from the types of stocks in which the Fund invests will trail returns from global stock markets.     Small-, mid-, and large-cap stocks each tend to go through cycles of doing better-or worse-than other segments of the stock market or the global stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years. Historically,     small- and mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than large-cap stocks. Small and mid-size companies tend to have greater stock volatility because, among other things, these companies are more sensitive to changing economic conditions.</p><p>Country/regional risk, which is the chance that world events-such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters-will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions.
