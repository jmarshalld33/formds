These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the Fund&#8217;s performance.

The Fund will emphasize common stock of companies with mid to large stock market capitalizations; however, the Fund also may invest in the common stock of small companies. The Fund generally invests at least 65% of its total assets in equity securities. Equity securities consist of common stock and American Depositary Receipts (&#8220;ADRs&#8221;) which are receipts typically issued by an American bank or trust company that evidence underlying securities issued by a foreign company. In addition to ADRs, the Fund may also invest up to 20% of its total assets in securities of foreign companies.<br /><br />The Fund is a &#8220;feeder&#8221; fund that invests all of its assets in a &#8220;master&#8221; portfolio, the Master Focus Growth LLC (the &#8220;Master LLC&#8221;), a mutual fund that has the same investment objective and strategies as the Fund. All investments will be made at the Master LLC level. This structure is sometimes called a &#8220;master/feeder&#8221; structure. The Fund&#8217;s investment results will correspond directly to the investment results of the Master LLC. For simplicity, this prospectus uses the term &#8220;Fund&#8221; to include the Master LLC."
