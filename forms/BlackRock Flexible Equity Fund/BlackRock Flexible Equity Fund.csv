The Fund seeks to invest primarily in securities issued by North American companies. The Fund may invest in companies of any capitalization size, style or sector. Equity securities consist primarily of common stock, preferred stock, securities convertible into common stock and securities or other instruments whose price is linked to the value of common stock.<br /><br /> The Fund may also invest in equity securities of foreign issuers, including securities of companies in emerging market countries. The Fund may invest directly in foreign securities or indirectly through depositary receipts and similar instruments.<br /><br /> The Fund may invest in derivatives, including but not limited to, total return and credit default swaps, options, futures, options on futures and swaps, and foreign exchange transactions, for hedging purposes, as well as to enhance the return on its portfolio investments.<br /><br /> The Fund may invest up to 20% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in fixed income securities when, in the view of the portfolio manager, these securities offer better risk-adjusted return potential than equity securities. The Fund may invest in fixed income securities of any rating, which may include high yield securities (commonly called &#8220;junk bonds&#8221;), and the Fund may invest up to 10% of its net assets in distressed securities that are in default or the issuers of which are in bankruptcy.<br /><br /> The Fund may seek to provide exposure (up to 20% of the Fund&#8217;s total assets) to the investment returns of real assets that trade in the commodity markets through investment in commodity-linked derivative instruments and investment vehicles that exclusively invest in commodities such as exchange traded funds, which are designed to provide exposure to commodity markets without direct investment in physical commodities. The Fund may gain such exposure to commodity markets by investing up to 20% of its total assets in BlackRock Flexible Equity Fund Subsidiary, Ltd. (the &#8220;Subsidiary&#8221;), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Fund formed in the Cayman Islands, which invests primarily in commodity-related instruments.<br /><br /> In order to seek to mitigate risk or lower overall volatility, the Fund may invest up to 20% of its net assets in cash or cash equivalents."

Performance for the periods prior to July 31, 2012 shown below is based on the investment strategies utilized by the Fund prior to July 31, 2012, which focused on investing in equity securities issued by U.S. mid-capitalization value companies.<br /><br />On January 31, 2005, the Fund reorganized with the State Street Research Mid-Cap Value Fund (the &#8220;SSR Fund&#8221;), which had an investment objective and strategies similar to those of the Fund prior to July 31, 2012. For periods prior to January 31, 2005 (the commencement date of operations of Service Shares), the chart and table show performance information for the Investor A Shares of the SSR Fund adjusted to reflect the class specific fees applicable to Service Shares. The information shows you how the Fund&#8217;s performance has varied year by year and provides some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund as it was managed pursuant to its investment objective and investment strategies prior to July 31, 2012. Effective July 31, 2012, the Fund changed its benchmark index from the Russell Midcap<sup>&#174;</sup> Value Index to the Standard & Poor&#8217;s 500<sup>&#174;</sup> Index (&#8220;S&P 500 Index&#8221;) in conjunction with the Fund&#8217;s new investment strategy and its exposure to a broader range of equity securities. The table compares the Fund&#8217;s performance to that of the S&P 500 Index and the Russell Midcap<sup>&#174;</sup> Value Index. As with all such investments, past performance (before and after taxes) is not an indication of future results. Sales charges are not reflected in the bar chart. If they were, returns would be less than those shown. However, the table includes all applicable fees and sales charges.

Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000001871_MemberInvestorAndInstituionalShares_Member,,,,,"Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in Flexible Equity Fund, as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment, may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. The following is a summary description of principal risks of investing in the Fund.<ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><p style=""PADDING-LEFT: 15px""><b>Commodities Related Investments Risk</b> &#8212; Exposure to the commodities markets may subject the Fund to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities. The value of commodity-linked derivative investments may be affected by changes in overall market movements, commodity index volatility, changes in interest rates, or sectors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as drought, floods, weather, embargoes, tariffs and international economic, political and regulatory developments.</p></li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><p style=""PADDING-LEFT: 15px""><b>Convertible Securities Risk</b> &#8212; The market value of a convertible security performs like that of a regular debt security; that is, if market interest rates rise, the value of a convertible security usually falls. In addition, convertible securities are subject to the risk that the issuer will not be able to pay interest or dividends when due, and their market value may change based on changes in the issuer&#8217;s credit rating or the market&#8217;s perception of the issuer&#8217;s creditworthiness. Since it derives a portion of its value from the common stock into which it may be converted, a convertible security is also subject to the same types of market and issuer risks that apply to the underlying common stock.</p></li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><p style=""PADDING-LEFT: 15px""><b>Credit Risk</b> &#8212; Credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of a security will not be able to make payments of interest and principal when due. Changes in an issuer&#8217;s credit rating or the market&#8217;s perception of an issuer&#8217;s creditworthiness may also affect the value of the Fund&#8217;s investment in that issuer.</p></li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><p style=""PADDING-LEFT: 15px""><b>Debt Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Debt securities, such as bonds, involve credit risk. Debt securities are also subject to interest rate risk.</p></li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><p style=""PADDING-LEFT: 15px""><b>Depositary Receipts Risk</b>  &#8212; The issuers of unsponsored depositary receipts are not obligated to disclose information that is, in the United States, considered material. Therefore, there may be less information available regarding these issuers and there may not be a correlation between such information and the market value of the depositary receipts. Depositary receipts are generally subject to the same risks as the foreign securities that they evidence or into which they may be converted.</p></li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><p style=""PADDING-LEFT: 15px""><b>Derivatives Risk</b> &#8212; The Fund&#8217;s use of derivatives may reduce the Fund&#8217;s returns and/or increase volatility. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, an index or a market to fluctuate significantly in price within a short time period. Derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund&#8217;s use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the overall securities markets. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund to value accurately. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Recent legislation calls for new regulation of the derivatives markets. The extent and impact of the regulation is not yet known and may not be known for some time. New regulation may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, or may otherwise adversely affect the value or performance of derivatives.</p></li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><p style=""PADDING-LEFT: 15px""><b>Emerging Markets Risk</b>  &#8212; Emerging markets are riskier than more developed markets because they tend to develop unevenly and may never fully develop. Investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative. Emerging markets are more likely to experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations, which adversely affect returns to U.S. investors.

Performance for the periods prior to July 31, 2012 shown below is based on the investment strategies utilized by the Fund prior to July 31, 2012, which focused on investing in equity securities issued by U.S. mid-capitalization value companies.<br/><br/>On January 31, 2005, the Fund reorganized with the State Street Research Mid-Cap Value Fund (the &#8220;SSR Fund&#8221;), which had an investment objective and strategies similar to those of the Fund prior to July 31, 2012. For periods prior to January 31, 2005, the chart and table show performance information for the SSR Fund. The returns for Class R Shares prior to July 30, 2010 (the date Class R Shares commenced operations) are based on the Fund&#8217;s Investor A Shares adjusted to reflect the class specific fees applicable to Class R Shares. The information shows you how the Fund&#8217;s performance has varied year by year and provides some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund as it was managed pursuant to its investment objective and investment strategies prior to July 31, 2012. Effective July 31, 2012, the Fund changed its benchmark index from the Russell Midcap<sup>&#174;</sup> Value Index to the Standard & Poor&#8217;s 500<sup>&#174;</sup> Index (&#8220;S&P 500 Index&#8221;) in conjunction with the Fund&#8217;s new investment strategy and its exposure to a broader range of equity securities.

Strategy Narrative [Text Block],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000001871_MemberServiceShares_Member,,,,,"Under normal circumstances, Flexible Equity Fund invests at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in equity securities and equity-like securities and instruments with similar economic characteristics. The Fund seeks to invest primarily in securities issued by North American companies. The Fund may invest in companies of any capitalization size, style or sector. Equity securities consist primarily of common stock, preferred stock, securities convertible into common stock and securities or other instruments whose price is linked to the value of common stock.<br /><br />The Fund may also invest in equity securities of foreign issuers, including securities of companies in emerging market countries. The Fund may invest directly in foreign securities or indirectly through depositary receipts and similar instruments.<br /><br />The Fund may invest in derivatives, including but not limited to, total return and credit default swaps, options, futures, options on futures and swaps, and foreign exchange transactions, for hedging purposes, as well as to enhance the return on its portfolio investments.<br /><br />The Fund may invest up to 20% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in fixed income securities when, in the view of the portfolio manager, these securities offer better risk-adjusted return potential than equity securities. The Fund may invest in fixed income securities of any rating, which may include high yield securities (commonly called &#8220;junk bonds&#8221;), and the Fund may invest up to 10% of its net assets in distressed securities that are in default or the issuers of which are in bankruptcy.<br /><br />The Fund may seek to provide exposure (up to 20% of the Fund&#8217;s total assets) to the investment returns of real assets that trade in the commodity markets through investment in commodity-linked derivative instruments and investment vehicles that exclusively invest in commodities such as exchange traded funds, which are designed to provide exposure to commodity markets without direct investment in physical commodities. The Fund may gain such exposure to commodity markets by investing up to 20% of its total assets in BlackRock Flexible Equity Fund Subsidiary, Ltd. (the &#8220;Subsidiary&#8221;), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Fund formed in the Cayman Islands, which invests primarily in commodity-related instruments.<br /><br />In order to seek to mitigate risk or lower overall volatility, the Fund may invest up to 20% of its net assets in cash or cash equivalents."
Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_29Jan2012_28Jan2013S000001871_MemberServiceShares_Member,,,,,"Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in Flexible Equity Fund, as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment, may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. The following is a summary description of principal risks of investing in the Fund.<ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><p style=""PADDING-LEFT: 15px""><b>Commodities Related Investments Risk</b> &#8212; Exposure to the commodities markets may subject the Fund to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities. The value of commodity-linked derivative investments may be affected by changes in overall market movements, commodity index volatility, changes in interest rates, or sectors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as drought, floods, weather, embargoes, tariffs and international economic, political and regulatory developments.</p></li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><p style=""PADDING-LEFT: 15px""><b>Convertible Securities Risk</b> &#8212; The market value of a convertible security performs like that of a regular debt security; that is, if market interest rates rise, the value of a convertible security usually falls. In addition, convertible securities are subject to the risk that the issuer will not be able to pay interest or dividends when due, and their market value may change based on changes in the issuer&#8217;s credit rating or the market&#8217;s perception of the issuer&#8217;s creditworthiness. Since it derives a portion of its value from the common stock into which it may be converted, a convertible security is also subject to the same types of market and issuer risks that apply to the underlying common stock.</p></li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><p style=""PADDING-LEFT: 15px""><b>Credit Risk</b> &#8212; Credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of a security will not be able to make payments of interest and principal when due. Changes in an issuer&#8217;s credit rating or the market&#8217;s perception of an issuer&#8217;s creditworthiness may also affect the value of the Fund&#8217;s investment in that issuer.</p></li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><p style=""PADDING-LEFT: 15px""><b>Debt Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Debt securities, such as bonds, involve credit risk. Debt securities are also subject to interest rate risk.</p></li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><p style=""PADDING-LEFT: 15px""><b>Depositary Receipts Risk</b>  &#8212; The issuers of unsponsored depositary receipts are not obligated to disclose information that is, in the United States, considered material. Therefore, there may be less information available regarding these issuers and there may not be a correlation between such information and the market value of the depositary receipts. Depositary receipts are generally subject to the same risks as the foreign securities that they evidence or into which they may be converted.</p></li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><p style=""PADDING-LEFT: 15px""><b>Derivatives Risk</b> &#8212; The Fund&#8217;s use of derivatives may reduce the Fund&#8217;s returns and/or increase volatility. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, an index or a market to fluctuate significantly in price within a short time period. Derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund&#8217;s use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the overall securities markets. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund to value accurately. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Recent legislation calls for new regulation of the derivatives markets. The extent and impact of the regulation is not yet known and may not be known for some time. New regulation may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, or may otherwise adversely affect the value or performance of derivatives.</p></li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><p style=""PADDING-LEFT: 15px""><b>Emerging Markets Risk</b>  &#8212; Emerging markets are riskier than more developed markets because they tend to develop unevenly and may never fully develop. Investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative. Emerging markets are more likely to experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations, which adversely affect returns to U.S. investors. In addition, many emerging securities markets have far lower trading volumes and less liquidity than developed markets.</p></li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><p style=""PADDING-LEFT: 15px""><b>Equity Securities Risk</b>  &#8212; Stock markets are volatile. The price of equity securities fluctuates based on changes in a company&#8217;s financial condition and overall market and economic conditions.</p></li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><p style=""PADDING-LEFT: 15px""><b>Foreign Securities Risk</b> &#8212; Foreign investments often involve special risks not present in U.S. investments that can increase the chances that the Fund will lose money.

The Subsidiary is not registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &#8220;Investment Company Act&#8221;), and, unless otherwise noted in this prospectus, is not subject to all the investor protections of the Investment Company Act. However, the Fund wholly owns and controls the Subsidiary, and the Fund and the Subsidiary are both managed by BlackRock, making it unlikely that the Subsidiary will take action contrary to the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. Changes in the laws of the United States and/or the Cayman Islands could result in the inability of the Fund and/or the Subsidiary to operate as described in this prospectus and the Statement of Additional Information and could adversely affect the Fund.</p></li></ul><ul type=""square""><li style=""margin-left:-20px""><p style=""PADDING-LEFT: 15px""><b>Tax and Regulatory Risk</b> &#8212; The tax treatment of derivative instruments, including commodity-linked derivative instruments, may be affected by changes in legislation, regulations or other legally binding authority that could affect the character, timing and amount of the Fund&#8217;s taxable income or gains and distributions.</p></li></ul>In late July 2011, the IRS suspended the granting of private letter rulings that concluded that the income and gain generated by a registered investment company&#8217;s investments in commodity-linked notes, and the income generated from investments in controlled foreign subsidiaries that invest in physical commodities and/or commodity-linked derivative instruments, would be &#8220;qualifying income&#8221; for regulated investment company qualification purposes. As a result, there can be no assurance that the IRS will treat such income and gain as &#8220;qualifying income.&#8221; If the IRS makes an adverse determination relating to the treatment of such income and gain, the Fund would likely need to change its investment strategies, which could adversely affect the Fund."
