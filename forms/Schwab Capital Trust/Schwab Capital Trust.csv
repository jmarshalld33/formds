Strategy Narrative [Text Block],Duration_02Apr2012_01Apr2013S000006809_Member,,,,,"<b>To pursue its goal, the fund primarily invests in a diversified portfolio of debt instruments that is designed to track the performance of the Barclays U.S. Government/Credit: 1-5 Years Index. </b>The fund uses the index as a guide in structuring the fund&#8217;s portfolio and selecting its investments. However, the fund is not required to invest any percentage of its assets in the securities represented in the index. Under normal circumstances, the dollar-weighted average maturity of the fund&#8217;s portfolio is not expected to exceed three years.<br/><br/>The fund normally invests at least 80% of its net assets in debt instruments of varying maturities. The fund will notify its shareholders at least 60 days before changing this policy. The fund invests primarily in investment grade instruments. The fund may invest in fixed-, variable- or floating-rate debt instruments. The fund also may invest in debt instruments of domestic and foreign issuers.<br/><br/>The fund may lend its securities to certain financial institutions to earn additional income. The fund may also invest in derivative instruments, principally futures contracts. The fund typically uses futures as a substitute for taking a position in the underlying asset or as a part of a strategy designed to reduce exposure to other risks.<br/><br/>The fund may buy and sell portfolio securities actively.

Risk [Heading],Duration_02Apr2012_01Apr2013S000006809_Member,,,,,<b>Principal risks </b>
Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_02Apr2012_01Apr2013S000006809_Member,,,,,"The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund&#8217;s principal risks include:<br/><br/><b>Market Risk. </b>Bond markets rise and fall daily. As with any investment whose performance is tied to these markets, the value of your investment in the fund will fluctuate, which means that you could lose money.<br/><br/><b>Investment Style Risk. </b>The fund invests in securities of the short-term bond market, as measured by the index. The fund is designed to follow the performance of the index during upturns as well as downturns. As a result, the fund will not take steps to reduce market exposure or lessen the effects of a declining market.<br/><br/><b>Tracking Error Risk. </b>The fund is designed to track the performance of its benchmark index, although it may not be successful in doing so. The divergence between the performance of a fund and its benchmark index, positive or negative, is called &#8220;tracking error.&#8221; Tracking error can be caused by many factors and it may be significant. For example, the fund is not required to invest any percentage of its assets in securities represented in its benchmark index and may not invest in certain securities in the benchmark index, or match the securities&#8217; weightings to the benchmark, due to regulatory, operational, custodial or liquidity constraints; corporate transactions; asset valuations; transaction costs and timing; tax considerations; and index rebalancing, which may result in tracking error.<br/><br/><b>Interest Rate Risk. </b>Interest rates will rise and fall over time. During periods when interest rates are low, the fund&#8217;s yield and total return also may be low. Changes in interest rates also may affect the fund&#8217;s share price: a sharp rise in interest rates could cause the fund&#8217;s share price to fall. The longer the fund&#8217;s duration, the more sensitive to interest rate movements its share price is likely to be.<br/><br/><b>Credit Risk. </b>The fund is subject to the risk that a decline in the credit quality of a portfolio investment could cause the fund to lose money or underperform. The fund could lose money if the issuer or guarantor of a portfolio investment fails to make timely principal or interest payments or otherwise honor its obligations.<br/><br/><b>Liquidity Risk. </b>A particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell. The fund may be unable to sell a security at an advantageous time or price.<br/><br/><b>Derivatives Risk. </b>The fund&#8217;s use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments and could cause the fund to lose more than the principal amount invested. In addition, investments in derivatives may involve leverage, which means a small percentage of assets invested in derivatives can have a disproportionately large impact on the fund. However, these risks are less severe when the fund uses derivatives for hedging rather than to enhance the fund&#8217;s returns or as a substitute for a position or security.<br/><br/><b>Foreign Investment Risk. </b>The fund&#8217;s investments in securities of foreign issuers may involve certain risks that are greater than those associated with investments in securities of U.S. issuers. These include: risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions; changes in currency exchange rates or exchange control regulations (including limitations on currency movements and exchanges); differing accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards and practices; differing securities market structures; and higher transaction costs.<br/><br/><b>Leverage Risk. </b>Certain fund transactions, such as derivatives, may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the fund to greater risk. Leverage tends to magnify the effect of any decrease or increase in the value of the fund&#8217;s portfolio securities. The use of leverage may cause the fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it would not be advantageous to do so in order to satisfy its obligations.<br/><br/><b>Securities Lending Risk. </b>Securities lending involves the risk of loss of rights in the collateral or delay in recovery of the collateral if the borrower fails to return the security loaned or becomes insolvent.<br/><br/><b>Lack of Governmental Insurance or Guarantee. </b>An investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and it is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency.<br/><br/>For more information on the risks of investing in the fund please see the &#8220;Fund details&#8221; section in the prospectus."

Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_02Apr2012_01Apr2013S000006810_Member,,,,,"The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund&#8217;s principal risks include:<br/><br/><b>Market Risk.</b> Bond markets rise and fall daily. As with any investment whose performance is tied to these markets, the value of your investment in the fund will fluctuate, which means that you could lose money.<br/><br/><b>Investment Style Risk.</b> The fund invests in securities of the bond market, as measured by the index. The fund is designed to follow the performance of the index during upturns as well as downturns. As a result, the fund will not take steps to reduce market exposure or lessen the effects of a declining market.<br/><br/><b>Tracking Error Risk. </b>The fund is designed to track the performance of its benchmark index, although it may not be successful in doing so. The divergence between the performance of a fund and its benchmark index, positive or negative, is called &#8220;tracking error.&#8221; Tracking error can be caused by many factors and it may be significant. For example, the fund is not required to invest any percentage of its assets in securities represented in its benchmark index and may not invest in certain securities in the benchmark index, or match the securities&#8217; weightings to the benchmark, due to regulatory, operational, custodial or liquidity constraints; corporate transactions; asset valuations; transaction costs and timing; tax considerations; and index rebalancing, which may result in tracking error.<br/><br/><b>Interest Rate Risk.</b> Interest rates will rise and fall over time. During periods when interest rates are low, the fund&#8217;s yield and total return also may be low. Changes in interest rates also may affect the fund&#8217;s share price: a sharp rise in interest rates could cause the fund&#8217;s share price to fall. The longer the fund&#8217;s duration, the more sensitive to interest rate movements its share price is likely to be.<br/><br/><b>Credit Risk.</b> The fund is subject to the risk that a decline in the credit quality of a portfolio investment could cause the fund to lose money or underperform. The fund could lose money if the issuer or guarantor of a portfolio investment fails to make timely principal or interest payments or otherwise honor its obligations.<br/><br/><b>Liquidity Risk.</b> A particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell. The fund may be unable to sell a security at an advantageous time or price.<br/><br/><b>Prepayment and Extension Risk.</b> The fund&#8217;s investments are subject to the risk that the securities may be paid off earlier or later than expected. Either situation could cause the fund to hold securities paying lower-than-market rates of interest, which could hurt the fund&#8217;s yield or share price.<br/><br/><b>Derivatives Risk.</b> The fund&#8217;s use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments and could cause the fund to lose more than the principal amount invested. In addition, investments in derivatives may involve leverage, which means a small percentage of assets invested in derivatives can have a disproportionately large impact on the fund. However, these risks are less severe when the fund uses derivatives for hedging rather than to enhance the fund&#8217;s returns or as a substitute for a position or security.<br/><br/><b>Foreign Investment Risk. </b>The fund&#8217;s investments in securities of foreign issuers may involve certain risks that are greater than those associated with investments in securities of U.S. issuers. These include: risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions; changes in currency exchange rates or exchange control regulations (including limitations on currency movements and exchanges); differing accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards and practices; differing securities market structures; and higher transaction costs.<br/><br/><b>Mortgage Dollar Rolls Risk.</b> Mortgage dollar rolls are transactions in which the fund sells mortgage-backed securities to a dealer and simultaneously agrees to repurchase similar securities in the future at a predetermined price. The fund&#8217;s mortgage dollar rolls could lose money if the price of the mortgage-backed securities sold falls below the agreed upon repurchase price, or if the counterparty is unable to honor the agreement.<br/><br/><b>Leverage Risk.</b> Certain fund transactions, such as derivatives and mortgage dollar rolls, may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the fund to greater risk. Leverage tends to magnify the effect of any decrease or increase in the value of the fund&#8217;s portfolio securities. The use of leverage may cause the fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it would not be advantageous to do so in order to satisfy its obligations.<br/><br/><b>Securities Lending Risk.</b> Securities lending involves the risk of loss of rights in the collateral or delay in recovery of the collateral if the borrower fails to return the security loaned or becomes insolvent.<br/><br/><b>Lack of Governmental Insurance or Guarantee.</b> An investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and it is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency.  <br/><br/>For more information on the risks of investing in the fund please see the &#8220;Fund details&#8221; section in the prospectus."

In addition to GNMA securities, the fund may invest in securities issued by the U.S. government or its other agencies and instrumentalities, such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) and Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs).<br/><br/>The fund may also invest in mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, repurchase agreements, and commercial paper. The fund also may invest in derivative instruments, principally futures contracts. The fund typically uses futures as a substitute for taking a position in the underlying asset or as part of a strategy designed to reduce exposure to other risks. The fund is not subject to any maturity or duration restrictions. The fund also may seek to obtain market exposure to the instruments in which it invests by entering into a series of purchase and sale contracts or by using other investment techniques, such as mortgage dollar rolls.<br/><br/>For temporary defensive purposes during unusual market conditions, the fund may invest up to 100% of its assets in cash, cash equivalents or other high quality short-term investments. When the fund engages in such activities, the fund would not be pursuing its investment strategy and, as a result, it may not achieve its investment goal.<br/><br/>The fund may buy and sell portfolio securities actively. If it does, its portfolio turnover rate and transaction costs will rise, which may lower fund performance and increase the likelihood of capital gain distributions."

The fund invests primarily in fixed income instruments issued by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities, and U.S. companies and entities. The fund may also invest in U.S. dollar denominated fixed income instruments issued by non-U.S. and emerging market governments, governmental agencies, companies and entities and supranational entities. Under normal circumstances, the dollar- weighted average maturity of the fund&#8217;s portfolio is expected to be between three years and ten years.<br/><br/>The fund may invest in fixed-, variable- or floating-rate bonds of any kind, including, government and agency bonds, corporate bonds, commercial and residential mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, asset-backed securities, hybrid securities and preferred securities.<br/><br/>The fund invests at least 75% of its net assets in investment grade bonds as rated by independent rating agencies, or if unrated, determined by the investment adviser to be of comparable quality. The fund may also invest up to 10% of its net assets in bonds rated below investment-grade (sometimes called junk bonds) or their unrated equivalents as determined by the investment adviser. The fund may invest in bonds having ultra-short, short-, intermediate-and long-term maturities.<br/><br/>The fund also may invest in derivative instruments, principally futures contracts. The fund typically uses derivatives as a substitute for taking a position in the underlying asset or as a strategy designed to manage exposure to other risks. The fund may also invest in mortgage dollar rolls.<br/><br/>The fund selects investments across and within various market sectors based on the investment adviser&#8217;s assessment of economic, market, political and industry conditions and analysis of each issuer. In making this determination, the investment adviser may consider a variety of factors that it determines to be relevant from time to time, such as projected interest rate movements, volatility forecasts, technical data, industry cycles, political events and the issuer&#8217;s financial condition, earning estimates, management and industry position.<br/><br/>The fund may hold all of its assets in cash, cash equivalents and other short-term investments for temporary or defensive purposes. The fund may utilize such tactics when the investment adviser believes that market or economic or political conditions are unfavorable for investors. Under such circumstances, the fund may not achieve its investment objective."
Risk [Heading],Duration_02Apr2012_01Apr2013S000018876_Member,,,,,<b>Principal risks </b>
Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_02Apr2012_01Apr2013S000018876_Member,,,,,"The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund&#8217;s principal risks include:<br/><br/><b>Market Risk.</b> Bond markets rise and fall daily. As with any investment whose performance is tied to these markets, the value of your investment in the fund will fluctuate, which means that you could lose money.<br/><br/><b>Management Risk.</b> As an actively managed mutual fund, the fund is subject to the risk that its investment adviser will make poor security selections. The fund&#8217;s investment adviser applies its own investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the fund, but there can be no guarantee that they will produce the desired results.<br/><br/><b>Interest Rate Risk.</b> Interest rates will rise and fall over time. During periods when interest rates are low, the fund&#8217;s yield and total return also may be low. Changes in interest rates also may affect the fund&#8217;s share price: a sharp rise in interest rates could cause the fund&#8217;s share price to fall. The longer the fund&#8217;s duration, the more sensitive to interest rate movements its share price is likely to be.<br/><br/><b>Credit Risk.</b> The fund is subject to the risk that a decline in the credit quality of a portfolio investment could cause the fund to lose money or underperform. The fund could lose money if the issuer or guarantor of a portfolio investment fails to make timely principal or interest payments or otherwise honor its obligations.<br/><br/><b>Liquidity Risk.</b> A particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell. The fund may be unable to sell a security at an advantageous time or price.<br/><br/><b>Prepayment and Extension Risk.</b> The fund&#8217;s investments are subject to the risk that the securities may be paid off earlier or later than expected. Either situation could cause the fund to hold securities paying lower-than-market rates of interest, which could hurt the fund&#8217;s yield or share price.<br/><br/><b>High Yield Risk.</b> High yield securities and unrated securities of similar credit quality (sometimes called junk bonds) that the fund may invest in are subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risks. High yield securities are considered primarily speculative with respect to the issuer&#8217;s continuing ability to make principal and interest payments.<br/><br/><b>Foreign Investment Risk.</b> The fund&#8217;s investments in securities of foreign issuers may involve certain risks that are greater than those associated with investments in securities of U.S. issuers. These include: risks of adverse changes in foreign economic, political, regulatory and other conditions; changes in currency exchange rates or exchange control regulations (including limitations on currency movements and exchanges); differing accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards and practices; differing securities market structures; and higher transaction costs. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in emerging markets.<br/><br/><b>Emerging Markets Risk.</b> Emerging market countries may be more likely to experience political turmoil or rapid changes in market or economic conditions than more developed countries. Such countries often have less uniformity in accounting and reporting requirements and greater risk associated with the custody of securities. In addition, the financial stability of issuers (including governments) in emerging market countries may be more precarious than in other countries. As a result, there will tend to be an increased risk of price volatility associated with the fund&#8217;s investments in emerging market countries and, at times, it may be difficult to value such investments.<br/><br/><b>Derivatives Risk.</b> The fund&#8217;s use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments and could cause the fund to lose more than the principal amount invested. In addition, investments in derivatives may involve leverage, which means a small percentage of assets invested in derivatives can have a disproportionately large impact on the fund. However, these risks are less severe when the fund uses derivatives for hedging rather than to enhance the fund&#8217;s returns or as a substitute for a position or security.<br/><br/><b>Mortgage Dollar Rolls Risk.</b> Mortgage dollar rolls are transactions in which the fund sells mortgage-backed securities to a dealer and simultaneously agrees to repurchase similar securities in the future at a predetermined price. The fund&#8217;s mortgage dollar rolls could lose money if the price of the mortgage-backed securities sold falls below the agreed upon repurchase price, or if the counterparty is unable to honor the agreement.<br/><br/><b>Leverage Risk.</b> Certain fund transactions, such as derivatives and mortgage dollar rolls, may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the fund to greater risk. Leverage tends to magnify the effect of any decrease or increase in the value of the fund&#8217;s portfolio securities. The use of leverage may cause the fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it would not be advantageous to do so in order to satisfy its obligations.<br/><br/><b>Lack of Governmental Insurance or Guarantee.</b> An investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and it is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency.<br/><br/>For more information on the risks of investing in the fund please see the &#8220;Fund details&#8221; section in the prospectus."

Strategy Narrative [Text Block],Duration_02Apr2012_01Apr2013S000006819_Member,,,,,"<b>To pursue its goal, the fund generally invests in securities that are included in the Barclays U.S. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) Index (Series-L)<sup>SM</sup> (the &#8220;Index&#8221;).</b><sup>1</sup> The Index includes all publicly-issued U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) that have at least one year remaining to maturity, are rated investment grade and have $250 million or more of outstanding face value. The TIPS in the Index must be denominated in U.S. dollars and must be fixed-rate and non-convertible. The Index is market capitalization weighted and the TIPS in the Index are updated on the last business day of each month. As of February 28, 2013, there were 34 TIPS in the Index. TIPS are publicly issued, dollar denominated U.S. Government securities issued by the U.S. Treasury that have principal and interest payments linked to an official inflation measure (as measured by the Consumer Price Index, or CPI) and their payments are supported by the full faith and credit of the United States.  <br /><br />It is the fund&#8217;s policy that, under normal circumstances, it will invest at least 90% of its net assets in securities included in the Index. The fund will notify its shareholders at least 60 days before changing this policy. The fund will generally give the same weight to a given security as the Index does. However, when the investment adviser believes it is in the best interest of the fund, such as to avoid purchasing odd-lots (i.e., purchasing less than the usual number of shares traded for a security), for tax considerations, or to address liquidity considerations with respect to a security, the investment adviser may cause the fund&#8217;s weighting of a security to be more or less than the Index&#8217;s weighting of the security.  <br /><br />Under normal circumstances, the fund may invest up to 10% of its net assets in securities not included in its Index. The principal types of these investments include those that the investment adviser believes will help the fund track the Index, such as investments in (a) securities that are not represented in the Index but the investment adviser anticipates will be added to the Index; (b) high-quality liquid short-term investments, such as securities issued by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities, including obligations that are not guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury, and obligations that are issued by private issuers that are guaranteed as to principal or interest by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities, and (c) investment companies. The fund may also invest in cash, cash equivalents and money market funds, and enter into repurchase agreements to minimize the difference in performance that naturally exists between an index fund and its corresponding index.  <br /><br />The investment adviser typically seeks to track the price and yield performance of the Index by replicating the Index. This means that the fund generally expects that it will hold the same securities as those included in the Index. However, the investment adviser may use statistical sampling techniques if the investment adviser believes such use will best help the fund to track its Index or is otherwise in the best interest of the fund. Statistical sampling techniques involve investing in a limited number of Index securities that, when taken together, are expected to perform similarly to the Index as a whole. These techniques are based on a variety of factors, including interest rate and yield curve risk, maturity exposures, and other risk factors and characteristics. The fund generally expects that its yield and maturity will be similar to those of the Index. In addition, the fund generally expects that its weighted average effective duration will closely correspond to the weighted average effective duration of the Index, which as of February 28, 2013 was 8.2 years.  <br /><br />The investment adviser seeks to achieve, over time, a correlation between the fund&#8217;s performance and that of its Index, before fees and expenses, of 95% or better. However, there can be no guarantee that the fund will achieve a high degree of correlation with the Index. A number of factors may affect the fund&#8217;s ability to achieve a high correlation with its Index, including the degree to which the fund utilizes a sampling technique. The correlation between the performance of the fund and its Index may also diverge due to transaction costs, asset valuations, timing variances, and differences between the fund&#8217;s portfolio and the Index resulting from legal restrictions (such as diversification requirements) that apply to the fund but not to the Index.<br /><br /><sup>1</sup>  Index ownership &#8212; &#169; Barclays Inc. 2013.

Risk [Heading],Duration_02Apr2012_01Apr2013S000006819_Member,,,,,<b>Principal risks </b>
Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_02Apr2012_01Apr2013S000006819_Member,,,,,"The fund is subject to risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The fund&#8217;s principal risks include:<br /><br /><b>Market Risk.</b> Bond markets rise and fall daily. As with any investment whose performance is tied to these markets, the value of your investment in the fund will fluctuate, which means that you could lose money.<br /><br /><b>Investment Style Risk.</b> The fund is not actively managed. Therefore, the fund follows the securities included in the Index during upturns as well as downturns. Because of its indexing strategy, the fund does not take steps to reduce market exposure or to lessen the effects of a declining market. In addition, because of the fund&#8217;s expenses, the fund&#8217;s performance is normally below that of the Index.<br /><br /><b>Inflation Protected Security Risk.</b> The value of inflation protected securities, including TIPS, generally will fluctuate in response to changes in &#8220;real&#8221; interest rates, generally decreasing when real interest rates rise and increasing when real interest rates fall. In addition, interest payments on inflation-indexed securities will generally vary up or down along with the rate of inflation.<br /><br /><b>Interest Rate Risk.</b> Interest rates will rise and fall over time. During periods when interest rates are low, the fund&#8217;s yield and total return also may be low. Changes in interest rates also may affect the fund&#8217;s share price: a sharp rise in interest rates could cause the fund&#8217;s share price to fall. The longer the fund&#8217;s duration, the more sensitive to interest rate movements its share price is likely to be.<br /><br /><b>Credit Risk.</b> The fund is subject to the risk that a decline in the credit quality of a portfolio investment could cause the fund to lose money or underperform. The fund could lose money if the issuer or guarantor of a portfolio investment fails to make timely principal or interest payments or otherwise honor its obligations.<br /><br /><b>Liquidity Risk.</b> A particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell. The fund may be unable to sell a security at an advantageous time or price.<br /><br /><b>Sampling Index Tracking Risk.</b> To the extent the fund uses statistical sampling techniques, the fund will not fully replicate the Index and may hold securities not included in the Index. As a result, the fund will be subject to the risk that the investment adviser&#8217;s investment management strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of constraints, may not produce the intended results. If the fund uses a sampling approach, it may not track the return of the Index as well as it would if the fund purchased all of the securities in the Index.<br /><br /><b>Tracking Error Risk.</b>  As an index fund, the fund seeks to track the performance of its benchmark Index, although it may not be successful in doing so. The divergence between the performance of the fund and the Index, positive or negative, is called &#8220;tracking error&#8221;. Tracking error can be caused by many factors and it may be significant. For example, the fund may not invest in certain securities in the Index or match the securities&#8217; weighting to the benchmark.<br /><br /><b>Lack of Governmental Insurance or Guarantee.</b> An investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and it is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency.  <br /><br />For more information on the risks of investing in the fund please see the &#8220;Fund details&#8221; section in the prospectus."
