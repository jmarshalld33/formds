Performance Narrative [Text Block],Duration_27Oct2011_26Oct2012S000002321_Member,,,,,"<font style=""font-family:ARIAL"" size=""2"">The information shows you how the Fund's performance has varied year by year and provides some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund. The table compares the Fund's performance to that of the Russell 1000<sup style=""vertical-align:baseline; position:relative; bottom:.8ex"">&reg;</sup> Value Index and the Standard  & Poor's (""S&P"") 500<sup style=""vertical-align:baseline; position:relative; bottom:.8ex"">&reg;</sup> Index, which are relevant to the Fund because they have characteristics similar to the Fund's investment strategies. The returns for Class R Shares prior to January 3, 2003, the commencement of operations for Class R Shares, are based upon performance of the Fund's Institutional Shares. The returns for Class R Shares, however, are adjusted to reflect the distribution and service (12b-1) fees applicable to Class R Shares. As with all such investments, past performance (before and after taxes) is not an indication of future results. Sales charges are not reflected in the bar chart. If they were, returns would be less than those shown. However, the table includes all applicable fees and sales charges. If the Fund's investment manager and its affiliates had not waived or reimbursed certain Fund expenses during these periods, the Fund's returns would have been lower.
