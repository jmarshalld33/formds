Strategy Narrative [Text Block],Duration_27Oct2011_26Oct2012S000002724_Member,,,,,"<font style=""FONT-FAMILY: ARIAL"" size=""2"">The Fund invests in a diversified portfolio primarily consisting of equity securities of small cap issuers in various foreign countries and in the United States. Equity securities consist primarily of common and preferred stocks and depositary receipts, and include securities convertible into common stock, and securities or other instruments whose price is linked to the value of common stock. Depositary receipts include American Depositary Receipts (&#147;ADRs&#148;), European Depositary Receipts (&#147;EDRs&#148;), Global Depositary Receipts (&#147;GDRs&#148;) and unsponsored Depositary Receipts. ADRs are receipts typically issued by an American bank or trust company that evidence underlying securities issued by a foreign corporation. EDRs (issued in Europe) and GDRs (issued throughout the world) each evidence a similar ownership arrangement. In addition, the Fund may invest in derivative securities or instruments, such as options and futures, the value of which is based on a common stock or a group of common stocks. The Fund may use derivatives to hedge its investment portfolio against market, interest rate and currency risks or to seek to enhance its return. The derivatives that the Fund may use include indexed and inverse securities, options, futures, swaps and forward foreign exchange transactions.</font><br/><br/> <font style=""FONT-FAMILY: ARIAL"" size=""2"">Under normal circumstances, the Fund invests at least 80% of its assets in equity securities of small cap issuers. Small cap issuers are those whose market capitalization is similar to the market capitalization of companies in the Morgan Stanley Capital International (&#147;MSCI&#148;) All Country World Small Cap Index</font><font style=""font-family:ARIAL"" size=""1""><sup>SM</sup></font><font style=""font-family:ARIAL"" size=""2""> at the time of the Fund&#146;s investment. As of September 28, 2012, the MSCI All Country World Small Cap Index</font><font style=""font-family:ARIAL"" size=""1""><sup>SM</sup></font><font style=""font-family:ARIAL"" size=""2""> included companies with free float market capitalizations between $16.7 million and $5.984 billion.

The Fund may also invest in equity securities issued by emerging growth companies, which are companies of any market capitalization without a long or consistent history of earnings but that Fund management believes have the potential for earnings growth over an extended period of time.</font><br/><br/> <font style=""FONT-FAMILY: ARIAL"" size=""2"">Under normal circumstances, the Fund anticipates it will allocate a substantial amount (approximately 40% or more &#151; unless market conditions are not deemed favorable by Fund management, in which case the Fund would invest at least 30%) &#151; of its total assets in foreign securities, which may include securities (i) of foreign government issuers, (ii) of issuers organized or located outside the U.S., (iii) of issuers which primarily trade in a market located outside the U.S., or (iv) of issuers doing a substantial amount of business outside the U.S., which the Fund considers to be companies that derive at least 50% of their revenue or profits from business outside the U.S. or have at least 50% of their sales or assets outside the U.S. The Fund will allocate its assets among various regions and countries, including the United States (but in no less than three different countries). The Fund may invest in securities denominated in any currency. For temporary defensive purposes the Fund may deviate substantially from the allocation described above. </font>"
Risk Narrative [Text Block],Duration_27Oct2011_26Oct2012S000002724_Member,,,,,"<font style=""FONT-FAMILY: ARIAL"" size=""2"">Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in the Fund, as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment, may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. The following is a summary description of principal risks of investing in the Fund.  </font>  <ul type=""square""><li><font style=""FONT-FAMILY: ARIAL"" size=""2""><b><i>Depositary Receipts Risk</i></b> &#8212; The issuers of unsponsored depositary receipts are not obligated to disclose information that is, in the United States, considered material. Therefore, there may be less information available regarding these issuers and there may not be a correlation between such information and the market value of the depositary receipts. Depositary receipts are generally subject to the same risks as the foreign securities that they evidence or into which they may be converted. </font></li></ul>  <ul type=""square""><li><font style=""FONT-FAMILY: ARIAL"" size=""2""><b><i>Derivatives Risk</i></b> &#8212; The Fund&#146;s use of derivatives may reduce the Fund&#146;s returns and/or increase volatility. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, an index or a market to fluctuate significantly in price within a short time period. Derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund&#146;s use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the overall securities markets. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund to value accurately. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Recent legislation calls for new regulation of the derivatives markets. The extent and impact of the regulation is not yet known and may not be known for some time. New regulation may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, or may otherwise adversely affect the value or performance of derivatives. </font></li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li><font style=""FONT-FAMILY: ARIAL"" size=""2""><b><i>Emerging Markets Risk</i></b> &#8212; Emerging markets are riskier than more developed markets because they tend to develop unevenly and may never fully develop. Investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative. Emerging markets are more likely to experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations, which adversely affect returns to U.S. investors. In addition, many emerging securities markets have far lower trading volumes and less liquidity than developed markets.  </font></li></ul> <ul type=""square""><li><font style=""FONT-FAMILY: ARIAL"" size=""2""><b><i>Equity Securities Risk </i></b> &#8212; Stock markets are volatile. The price of equity securities fluctuates based on changes in a company&#146;s financial condition and overall market and economic conditions. </font></li></ul>    <ul type=""square""><li><font style=""FONT-FAMILY: ARIAL"" size=""2""><b><i>Foreign Securities Risk</i></b> &#8212; Foreign investments often involve special risks not present in U.S. investments that can increase the chances that the Fund will lose money.

Effective October 1, 2012, one of the Fund&#146;s benchmarks against which it measures its performance, the MSCI World Small Cap Index, was replaced with the MSCI All Country World Small Cap Index. BlackRock believes the MSCI All Country World Small Cap Index more accurately reflects the investment strategy of the Fund. The MSCI All Country World Small Cap Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is designed to measure equity market results of smaller capitalization companies in both developed and emerging markets. The returns for Class R Shares prior to February 4, 2003, the commencement of operation of Class R Shares, are based upon performance of the Fund&#146;s Institutional Shares. The returns for Class R Shares, however, are adjusted to reflect the distribution and service (12b-1) fees applicable to Class R Shares. As with all such investments, past performance (before and after taxes) is not an indication of future results. Sales charges are not reflected in the bar chart. If they were, returns would be less than those shown. However, the table includes all applicable fees and sales charges. If the Fund&#146;s investment manager and its affiliates had not waived or reimbursed certain Fund expenses during these periods, the Fund&#146;s returns would have been lower. Updated information on the Fund&#146;s performance can be obtained by visiting http://www.blackrock.com/funds or can be obtained by phone at 800-882-0052. </font>"
