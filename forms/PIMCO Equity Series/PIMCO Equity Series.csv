The Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in Institutional Class, Class P, Administrative Class, Class D, Class A, Class C or Class R shares of the Fund with the costs of investing in other mutual funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the noted class of shares for the time periods indicated, and then redeem all your shares at the end of those periods. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the same.

A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example tables, affect the Fund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 28% of the average value of its portfolio.</p>"

Strategy Narrative [Text Block],c_S000034646_AAAA,,,,,"<p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing under normal circumstances at least 80% of its assets in a diversified portfolio of income-producing investments, and will typically invest at least 50% of its assets in equity and equity-related securities. The Fund's investments in equity and equity-related securities include common and preferred stock (and securities convertible into, or that Pacific Investment Management Company LLC (""PIMCO"") expects to be exchanged for, common or preferred stock), as well as securities issued by real estate investment trusts, master limited partnerships and other equity trusts and depositary receipts. The Fund may invest in securities issued by large-capitalization, mid-capitalization and small-capitalization companies.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">When making equity investments, PIMCO uses bottom-up, fundamental analysis to seek to identify attractively valued issuers that currently pay dividends and have the potential for earnings and dividend growth over time. PIMCO seeks to increase portfolio diversification by investing in companies that are in various stages of the business life cycle. PIMCO also seeks to incorporate its extensive global macro insights into the portfolio construction process.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund may also invest in ""Fixed Income Instruments"" of varying maturities. Fixed Income Instruments include bonds, debt securities and other similar instruments issued by various U.S. and non-U.S. public- or private-sector entities. The debt investments of the Fund may include investment-grade securities and high yield securities (""junk bonds"") of any rating.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund's approach to fixed income securities selection incorporates PIMCO's global macroeconomic views and fixed income investment expertise. The Fund's fixed income assets are selected based on fundamental analysis, as well as PIMCO's view regarding the attractiveness of key investment risk factors.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund may also invest in derivative instruments, such as options, futures contracts, swap agreements, equity-linked notes, equity-linked securities and participatory notes, consistent with its investment objectives. The Fund may purchase or sell securities on a when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment basis and may engage in short sales. The Fund may also enter into reverse repurchase agreements and lend portfolio securities.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund may invest a significant portion of its assets in securities and instruments that are economically tied to foreign (non-U.S.) countries. The Fund may also invest in securities and instruments that are economically tied to emerging market countries. The Fund may obtain foreign currency exposure (from non-U.S. dollar-denominated securities or currencies) without limitation.</p>"

Risk Narrative [Text Block],c_S000034646_AAAA,,,,,"<p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">It is possible to lose money on an investment in the Fund.  The principal risks of investing in the Fund, which could adversely affect its net asset value, yield and total return are:</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Equity Risk:</b> the risk that the value of equity securities, such as common stocks and preferred stocks, may decline due to general market conditions which are not specifically related to a particular company or to factors affecting a particular industry or industries. Equity securities generally have greater price volatility than fixed income securities</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Dividend-Oriented Stocks Risk:</b> companies that have paid regular dividends to shareholders may decrease or eliminate dividend payments in the future. A decrease in dividend payments by an issuer may result in a decrease in the value of the security held by the Fund or the Fund receiving less income</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Value Investing Risk:</b> a value stock may decrease in price or may not increase in price as anticipated by PIMCO if it continues to be undervalued by the market or the factors that PIMCO believes will cause the stock price to increase do not occur</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Foreign (Non-U.S.) Investment Risk:</b> the risk that investing in foreign (non-U.S.) securities may result in the Fund experiencing more rapid and extreme changes in value than a fund that invests exclusively in securities of U.S. companies, due to smaller markets, differing reporting, accounting and auditing standards, increased risk of delayed settlement of portfolio transactions or loss of certificates of portfolio securities, and the risk of unfavorable foreign government actions, including nationalization, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, currency blockage, or political changes or diplomatic developments. Foreign securities may also be less liquid and more difficult to value than securities of U.S. issuers</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Emerging Markets Risk:</b> the risk of investing in emerging market securities, primarily increased foreign (non-U.S.) investment risk</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Market Risk:</b> the risk that the value of securities owned by the Fund may go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably, due to factors affecting securities markets generally or particular industries</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Issuer Risk:</b> the risk that the value of a security may decline for reasons directly related to the issuer, such as management performance, financial leverage and reduced demand for the issuer's goods or services</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Interest Rate Risk:</b> the risk that fixed income securities will decline in value because of an increase in interest rates; a fund with a longer average portfolio duration will be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than a fund with a shorter average portfolio duration</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Credit Risk:</b> the risk that the Fund could lose money if the issuer or guarantor of a fixed income security, or the counterparty to a derivative contract, is unable or unwilling to meet its financial obligations</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>High Yield and Distressed Company Risk:</b> the risk that high yield securities and unrated securities of similar credit quality (commonly known as ""junk bonds"") and securities of distressed companies may be subject to greater levels of credit, issuer and liquidity risks. Securities of distressed companies include both debt and equity securities. High yield securities and debt securities of distressed companies are considered primarily speculative with respect to the issuer's continuing ability to make principal and interest payments. Distressed companies may be engaged in restructurings or bankruptcy proceedings</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Currency Risk:</b> the risk that foreign currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar and affect the Fund's investments in foreign (non-U.S.) currencies or in securities that trade in, and receive revenues in, or in derivatives that provide exposure to, foreign (non-U.S.) currencies</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Real Estate Risk:</b> the risk that the Fund's investments in real estate investment trusts (""REITs"") or real estate-linked derivative instruments will subject the Fund to risks similar to those associated with direct ownership of real estate, including losses from casualty or condemnation, and changes in local and general economic conditions, supply and demand, interest rates, zoning laws, regulatory limitations on rents, property taxes and operating expenses. The Fund's investments in REITs or real estate-linked derivative instruments subject it to management and tax risks</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Liquidity Risk:</b> the risk that a particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell and that the Fund may be unable to sell illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price or achieve its desired level of exposure to a certain sector</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Leveraging Risk:</b> the risk that certain transactions of the Fund, such as reverse repurchase agreements, loans of portfolio securities, and the use of when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment transactions, or derivative instruments, may give rise to leverage, causing the Fund to be more volatile than if it had not been leveraged</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Management Risk:</b> the risk that the investment techniques and risk analyses applied by PIMCO will not produce the desired results and that legislative, regulatory, or tax developments may affect the investment techniques available to PIMCO and the individual portfolio manager in connection with managing the Fund. There is no guarantee that the investment objective of the Fund will be achieved</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Small-Cap and Mid-Cap Company Risk:</b> the risk that the value of securities issued by small-capitalization and mid-capitalization companies may go up or down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably, due to narrow markets and limited managerial and financial resources</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Derivatives Risk:</b> the risk of investing in derivative instruments, including liquidity, market, credit and management risks, mispricing or improper valuation. Changes in the value of the derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying asset, rate or index, and the Fund could lose more than the principal amount invested</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Mortgage-Related and Other Asset-Backed Risk:</b> the risk of investing in mortgage-related and other asset-backed securities, including interest rate risk, extension risk and prepayment risk</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Short Sale Risk:</b> the risk of entering into short sales, including the potential loss of more money than the actual cost of the investment, and the risk that the third party to the short sale may fail to honor its contract terms, causing a loss to the Fund</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Convertible Securities Risk:</b> the risk that the market values of convertible securities tend to decline as interest rates increase and, conversely, to increase as interest rates decline. A convertible security's market value, however, tends to reflect the market price of the common stock of the issuing company when that stock price approaches or is greater than the convertible security's ""conversion price""</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">Please see ""Description of Principal Risks"" in the Fund's prospectus for a more detailed description of the risks of investing in the Fund.

Strategy Narrative [Text Block],c_S000031024_AAAA,,,,,"<p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund is designed to provide concurrent exposure to a broad spectrum of emerging market asset classes, such as equity, fixed income and currencies, and other investments, including commodities. Pacific Investment Management Company LLC (""PIMCO"") uses a three-step active management approach in seeking to achieve the Fund's investment objective: 1) develop a target asset allocation to implement across the eligible investments; 2) identify relative value strategies designed to add value beyond the target asset allocation; and 3) utilize hedging techniques to reduce the Fund's exposure to certain severe, unanticipated market events that could significantly detract from returns. This active management approach is driven by PIMCO's global macroeconomic views, emerging markets expertise and experience across a wide range of investment instruments. The Fund's assets are allocated in a manner that reflects PIMCO's views regarding the attractiveness of key investment risk factors, considering both return potential and volatility, and includes an assessment of aggregate country, issuer and currency exposures.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">PIMCO evaluates these three steps daily and uses varying combinations of Acquired Funds (defined below) and/or direct investments in efforts to achieve the most efficient execution of PIMCO's investment views. Specifically, ""Acquired Funds"" refers to the following: funds of the Trust and funds of PIMCO Funds, an affiliated open-end investment company, except funds of funds (""Underlying PIMCO Funds"") and other affiliated funds, including funds of PIMCO ETF Trust, and unaffiliated funds in which the Fund may invest. Acquired Funds may or may not be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ""1940 Act""). To the extent Underlying PIMCO Funds are held, Institutional Class or Class M shares will be held. The Fund's investments may also include equity securities, Fixed Income Instruments of varying maturities, or related derivatives on such securities. ""Fixed Income Instruments"" include bonds, debt securities and other similar instruments issued by various U.S. and non-U.S. public or private-sector entities. The Fund will invest in such funds, securities, instruments and other investments to the extent permitted under the 1940 Act, or any exemptive relief therefrom. The Fund is non-diversified, which means that it may invest its assets in a smaller number of issuers than a diversified fund.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund invests under normal circumstances at least 80% of its assets in investments economically tied to emerging market countries. The Fund will typically invest 20% to 80% of its total assets in equity-related instruments (including investments in common stock, preferred stock, and equity-related Underlying PIMCO Funds or Acquired Funds). The Fund may invest up to 25% of its total assets in commodity-related investments (including investments in the PIMCO Cayman Commodity Fund V, Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Fund organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands (the ""Subsidiary"") and commodity-related Underlying PIMCO Funds or Acquired Funds). The Subsidiary is advised by PIMCO and primarily invests in commodity-linked derivative instruments backed by a portfolio of Fixed Income Instruments. As discussed in greater detail elsewhere in the prospectus, the Subsidiary (unlike the Fund) may invest without limitation in commodity index-linked swap agreements and other commodity-linked derivative instruments.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">In addition, with respect to its direct or indirect (through a fund) investments in equity securities, there is no limitation on the market capitalization range of the issuers in which the Fund may invest. Because the Fund primarily invests in issuers tied to emerging market countries, it typically invests in equity securities of issuers with smaller market capitalizations. The Fund may obtain foreign currency exposure (from non-U.S. dollar-denominated securities or currencies) without limitation. The Fund may invest, without limitation, in securities denominated in foreign currencies and in U.S. dollar-denominated securities of foreign issuers. The direct or indirect debt investments of the Fund may include high yield securities (""junk bonds"") of any rating. The Fund may purchase and sell securities on a when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment basis and may engage, without limitation, in short sales.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund's assets are not allocated according to a predetermined blend of investment exposures or mix of instruments. PIMCO has the flexibility to reallocate the Fund's assets among any or all of the investment exposures represented by affiliated or unaffiliated funds, or invest directly in securities, instruments and other investments, based on its ongoing analyses of the global economy and financial markets. While these analyses are performed daily, material shifts in investment exposures typically take place over longer periods of time, unless in response to a perceived short-term opportunity or market dislocation.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The ""total return"" sought by the Fund consists of income earned on the Fund's investments, plus capital appreciation, if any, which generally arises from increases in stock valuations, decreases in interest rates, foreign currency appreciation, or improving credit fundamentals for a particular sector or security. The Fund seeks long-term total return which exceeds the performance of the Fund's secondary benchmark (a blend of 50% MSCI Emerging Markets Index; 25% JPMorgan Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets Global Diversified Index (Unhedged); 25% JPMorgan Emerging Markets Bond Index (EMBI) Global). However, PIMCO will make tactical and strategic asset allocation decisions to deviate from the benchmark in order to maximize risk-adjusted total return.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">Summary information about the Underlying PIMCO Funds can be found in the Fund's prospectus. More complete information about the Underlying PIMCO Funds can be found in the Underlying PIMCO Funds' prospectuses, statements of additional information and financial reports. Additional Underlying PIMCO Funds may be added or deleted in the future without shareholder notifications.</p>"

               <b>Allocation Risk:</b> the risk that the Fund could lose money as a result of less than optimal or poor asset allocation decisions as to how its assets are allocated or reallocated</p>

               <b>Acquired Fund Risk:</b> the risk that the Fund's performance is closely related to the risks associated with the securities and other investments held by the Acquired Funds and that the ability of the Fund to achieve its investment objective will depend upon the ability of the Acquired Funds to achieve their investment objectives</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Equity Risk:</b> the risk that the value of equity securities, such as common stocks and preferred stocks, may decline due to general market conditions which are not specifically related to a particular company or to factors affecting a particular industry or industries. Equity securities generally have greater price volatility than fixed income securities</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Value Investing Risk:</b> a value stock may decrease in price or may not increase in price as anticipated by PIMCO if it continues to be undervalued by the market or the factors that PIMCO believes will cause the stock price to increase do not occur</p>

               <b>Foreign (Non-U.S.) Investment Risk:</b> the risk that investing in foreign (non-U.S.) securities may result in the Fund experiencing more rapid and extreme changes in value than a fund that invests exclusively in securities of U.S. companies, due to smaller markets, differing reporting, accounting and auditing standards, increased risk of delayed settlement of portfolio transactions or loss of certificates of portfolio securities, and the risk of unfavorable foreign government actions, including nationalization, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, currency blockage, or political changes or diplomatic developments. Foreign securities may also be less liquid and more difficult to value than securities of U.S. issuers</p>

               <b>Issuer Risk:</b> the risk that the value of a security may decline for reasons directly related to the issuer, such as management performance, financial leverage and reduced demand for the issuer's goods or services</p>

               <b>Interest Rate Risk:</b> the risk that fixed income securities will decline in value because of an increase in interest rates; a fund with a longer average portfolio duration will be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than a fund with a shorter average portfolio duration</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Credit Risk:</b> the risk that the Fund could lose money if the issuer or guarantor of a fixed income security, or the counterparty to a derivative contract, is unable or unwilling to meet its financial obligations</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>High Yield and Distressed Company Risk:</b> the risk that high yield securities and unrated securities of similar credit quality (commonly known as ""junk bonds"") and securities of distressed companies may be subject to greater levels of credit, issuer and liquidity risks. Securities of distressed companies include both debt and equity securities. High yield securities and debt securities of distressed companies are considered primarily speculative with respect to the issuer's continuing ability to make principal and interest payments. Distressed companies may be engaged in restructurings or bankruptcy proceedings</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Currency Risk:</b> the risk that foreign currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar and affect the Fund's investments in foreign (non-U.S.) currencies or in securities that trade in, and receive revenues in, or in derivatives that provide exposure to, foreign (non-U.S.) currencies</p>

               <b>Real Estate Risk:</b> the risk that the Fund's investments in real estate investment trusts (""REITs"") or real estate-linked derivative instruments will subject the Fund to risks similar to those associated with direct ownership of real estate, including losses from casualty or condemnation, and changes in local and general economic conditions, supply and demand, interest rates, zoning laws, regulatory limitations on rents, property taxes and operating expenses. The Fund's investments in REITs or real estate-linked derivative instruments subject it to management and tax risks</p>

               <b>Derivatives Risk:</b> the risk of investing in derivative instruments, including liquidity, market, credit and management risks, mispricing or improper valuation.

               <b>Convertible Securities Risk:</b> the risk that the market values of convertible securities tend to decline as interest rates increase and, conversely, to increase as interest rates decline. A convertible security's market value, however, tends to reflect the market price of the common stock of the issuing company when that stock price approaches or is greater than the convertible security's ""conversion price""</p>

               <b>Issuer Non-Diversification Risk:</b> the risks of focusing investments in a small number of issuers, including being more susceptible to risks associated with a single economic, political or regulatory occurrence than a more diversified portfolio might be. Funds that are ""non-diversified"" may invest a greater percentage of their assets in the securities of a single issuer (such as bonds issued by a particular state) than funds that are ""diversified""</p>

A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example tables, affect the Fund's performance.

Strategy Narrative [Text Block],c_S000034647_AAAA,,,,,"<p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing under normal circumstances at least 75% of its assets in equity and equity-related securities, including common and preferred stock (and securities convertible into, or that Pacific Investment Management Company LLC (""PIMCO"") expects to be exchanged for, common or preferred stock), as well as securities issued by real estate investment trusts, master limited partnerships and other equity trusts and depositary receipts. The Fund may invest in securities issued by large-capitalization, mid-capitalization and small-capitalization companies.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">When making equity investments, PIMCO uses bottom-up, fundamental analysis to seek to identify attractively valued issuers that currently pay dividends and have the potential for earnings and dividend growth over time. PIMCO seeks to increase portfolio diversification by investing in companies that are in various stages of the business life cycle. PIMCO also seeks to incorporate its extensive global macro insights into the portfolio construction process.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund may also invest in ""Fixed Income Instruments"" of varying maturities. Fixed Income Instruments include bonds, debt securities and other similar instruments issued by various U.S. and non-U.S. public- or private-sector entities. The debt investments of the Fund may include investment-grade securities and high yield securities (""junk bonds"") of any rating.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund may also invest in derivative instruments, such as options, futures contracts, swap agreements, equity-linked notes, equity-linked securities and participatory notes, consistent with its investment objectives. The Fund may purchase or sell securities on a when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment basis and may engage in short sales. The Fund may also enter into reverse repurchase agreements and lend portfolio securities.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund may invest a significant portion of its assets in securities and instruments that are economically tied to foreign (non-U.S.) countries. The Fund may also invest in securities and instruments that are economically tied to emerging market countries. The Fund may obtain foreign currency exposure (from non-U.S. dollar-denominated securities or currencies) without limitation.</p>"

The principal risks of investing in the Fund, which could adversely affect its net asset value, yield and total return are:</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Equity Risk:</b> the risk that the value of equity securities, such as common stocks and preferred stocks, may decline due to general market conditions which are not specifically related to a particular company or to factors affecting a particular industry or industries. Equity securities generally have greater price volatility than fixed income securities</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Dividend-Oriented Stocks Risk:</b> companies that have paid regular dividends to shareholders may decrease or eliminate dividend payments in the future. A decrease in dividend payments by an issuer may result in a decrease in the value of the security held by the Fund or the Fund receiving less income</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Value Investing Risk:</b> a value stock may decrease in price or may not increase in price as anticipated by PIMCO if it continues to be undervalued by the market or the factors that PIMCO believes will cause the stock price to increase do not occur</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Foreign (Non-U.S.) Investment Risk:</b> the risk that investing in foreign (non-U.S.) securities may result in the Fund experiencing more rapid and extreme changes in value than a fund that invests exclusively in securities of U.S. companies, due to smaller markets, differing reporting, accounting and auditing standards, increased risk of delayed settlement of portfolio transactions or loss of certificates of portfolio securities, and the risk of unfavorable foreign government actions, including nationalization, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, currency blockage, or political changes or diplomatic developments. Foreign securities may also be less liquid and more difficult to value than securities of U.S. issuers</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Emerging Markets Risk:</b> the risk of investing in emerging market securities, primarily increased foreign (non-U.S.) investment risk</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Market Risk:</b> the risk that the value of securities owned by the Fund may go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably, due to factors affecting securities markets generally or particular industries</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Issuer Risk:</b> the risk that the value of a security may decline for reasons directly related to the issuer, such as management performance, financial leverage and reduced demand for the issuer's goods or services</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Interest Rate Risk:</b> the risk that fixed income securities will decline in value because of an increase in interest rates; a fund with a longer average portfolio duration will be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than a fund with a shorter average portfolio duration</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Credit Risk:</b> the risk that the Fund could lose money if the issuer or guarantor of a fixed income security, or the counterparty to a derivative contract, is unable or unwilling to meet its financial obligations</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>High Yield and Distressed Company Risk:</b> the risk that high yield securities and unrated securities of similar credit quality (commonly known as ""junk bonds"") and securities of distressed companies may be subject to greater levels of credit, issuer and liquidity risks. Securities of distressed companies include both debt and equity securities. High yield securities and debt securities of distressed companies are considered primarily speculative with respect to the issuer's continuing ability to make principal and interest payments. Distressed companies may be engaged in restructurings or bankruptcy proceedings</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Currency Risk:</b> the risk that foreign currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar and affect the Fund's investments in foreign (non-U.S.) currencies or in securities that trade in, and receive revenues in, or in derivatives that provide exposure to, foreign (non-U.S.) currencies</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Real Estate Risk:</b> the risk that the Fund's investments in real estate investment trusts (""REITs"") or real estate-linked derivative instruments will subject the Fund to risks similar to those associated with direct ownership of real estate, including losses from casualty or condemnation, and changes in local and general economic conditions, supply and demand, interest rates, zoning laws, regulatory limitations on rents, property taxes and operating expenses. The Fund's investments in REITs or real estate-linked derivative instruments subject it to management and tax risks</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Liquidity Risk:</b> the risk that a particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell and that the Fund may be unable to sell illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price or achieve its desired level of exposure to a certain sector</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Leveraging Risk:</b> the risk that certain transactions of the Fund, such as reverse repurchase agreements, loans of portfolio securities, and the use of when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment transactions, or derivative instruments, may give rise to leverage, causing the Fund to be more volatile than if it had not been leveraged</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Management Risk:</b> the risk that the investment techniques and risk analyses applied by PIMCO will not produce the desired results and that legislative, regulatory, or tax developments may affect the investment techniques available to PIMCO and the individual portfolio manager in connection with managing the Fund. There is no guarantee that the investment objective of the Fund will be achieved</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Small-Cap and Mid-Cap Company Risk:</b> the risk that the value of securities issued by small-capitalization and mid-capitalization companies may go up or down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably, due to narrow markets and limited managerial and financial resources</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Derivatives Risk:</b> the risk of investing in derivative instruments, including liquidity, interest rate, market, credit and management risks, mispricing or improper valuation. Changes in the value of the derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying asset, rate or index, and the Fund could lose more than the principal amount invested</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Short Sale Risk:</b> the risk of entering into short sales, including the potential loss of more money than the actual cost of the investment, and the risk that the third party to the short sale may fail to honor its contract terms, causing a loss to the Fund</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Convertible Securities Risk:</b> the risk that the market values of convertible securities tend to decline as interest rates increase and, conversely, to increase as interest rates decline. A convertible security's market value, however, tends to reflect the market price of the common stock of the issuing company when that stock price approaches or is greater than the convertible security's ""conversion price""</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">Please see ""Description of Principal Risks"" in the Fund's prospectus for a more detailed description of the risks of investing in the Fund.

Strategy Narrative [Text Block],c_S000031023_AAAA,,,,,"<p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing under normal circumstances at least 80% of its assets in a diversified portfolio of investments economically tied to emerging market countries. The Fund will invest a substantial portion of its assets in equity and equity-related securities, including common and preferred stock (and securities convertible into, or that Pacific Investment Management Company LLC (""PIMCO"") expects to be exchanged for, common or preferred stock). The Fund may also invest in fixed income securities, including debt securities issued by both corporate and government issuers. The Fund may invest in commodity related instruments, including exchange-traded funds, futures and other investment companies.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">PIMCO has broad discretion to identify countries that it considers to qualify as emerging markets. The Fund emphasizes investments in countries with relatively low gross national product per capita and with the potential for higher trend economic growth. The Fund likely will focus its investments in companies having principal activities in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Latin America and the developing countries of Europe. Assets not invested in emerging market securities may be invested in instruments of any issuer in any market.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">When making investments, PIMCO uses a fundamental approach to stock-picking and attempts to identify investments that are undervalued by the market in comparison to PIMCO's assessment of companies' intrinsic value. Factors considered in the analysis include strong and improving cashflow generation, earnings profile, normalized profitability level and returns on capital. PIMCO seeks to incorporate its extensive global macro insight in determining the impact of economic factors on emerging equity markets and underlying securities in the portfolio. PIMCO evaluates the merits of each investment separately and there are no specific limitations on the value, asset size, earnings, duration, or industry classification of the Fund's investments. The Fund may invest in securities issued by large-capitalization, mid-capitalization and small-capitalization companies. The Fund generally considers large- and mid-cap companies to be those with market capitalizations greater than $1.5 billion.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund will seek to gain exposure to certain investments, such as the commodity futures markets or equity securities economically tied to India, primarily through investments in the PIMCO Mauritius Fund I, Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Fund organized under the laws of the Republic of Mauritius (the ""Subsidiary""). The Subsidiary is advised by PIMCO, and has the same investment objective as the Fund. As discussed in greater detail elsewhere in the prospectus, the Subsidiary (unlike the Fund) may obtain favorable tax treatment on its investments in equity securities economically tied to India and may also invest without limitation in commodity index-linked swap agreements and other commodity-linked derivative instruments.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The debt investments of the Fund may include investment-grade securities and high yield securities (""junk bonds"") of any rating. The Fund may obtain foreign currency exposure (from non-U.S. dollar-denominated securities or currencies) without limitation. The Fund may invest, without limitation, in securities denominated in foreign currencies and in U.S. dollar-denominated securities of foreign issuers. The Fund may invest in instruments whose return is based on the return of an emerging market security, such as a derivative instrument, rather than investing directly in emerging market securities. The Fund may also invest in other derivative instruments, such as options, futures contracts or swap agreements consistent with its investment objective, subject to applicable law and any other restrictions described in the Fund's prospectus or Statement of Additional Information. The Fund may purchase or sell securities on a when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment basis and may engage, without limitation, in short sales. The Fund may also enter into reverse repurchase agreements and lend portfolio securities.</p>"

The principal risks of investing in the Fund, which could adversely affect its net asset value, yield and total return are:</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Equity Risk:</b> the risk that the value of equity securities, such as common stocks and preferred stocks, may decline due to general market conditions which are not specifically related to a particular company or to factors affecting a particular industry or industries. Equity securities generally have greater price volatility than fixed income securities</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Foreign (Non-U.S.) Investment Risk:</b> the risk that investing in foreign (non-U.S.) securities may result in the Fund experiencing more rapid and extreme changes in value than a fund that invests exclusively in securities of U.S. companies, due to smaller markets, differing reporting, accounting and auditing standards, increased risk of delayed settlement of portfolio transactions or loss of certificates of portfolio securities, and the risk of unfavorable foreign government actions, including nationalization, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, currency blockage, or political changes or diplomatic developments. Foreign securities may also be less liquid and more difficult to value than securities of U.S. issuers</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Emerging Markets Risk:</b> the risk of investing in emerging market securities, primarily increased foreign (non-U.S.) investment risk</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Market Risk:</b> the risk that the value of securities owned by the Fund may go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably, due to factors affecting securities markets generally or particular industries</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Issuer Risk:</b> the risk that the value of a security may decline for reasons directly related to the issuer, such as management performance, financial leverage and reduced demand for the issuer's goods or services</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Interest Rate Risk:</b> the risk that fixed income securities will decline in value because of an increase in interest rates; a fund with a longer average portfolio duration will be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than a fund with a shorter average portfolio duration</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Credit Risk:</b> the risk that the Fund could lose money if the issuer or guarantor of a fixed income security, or the counterparty to a derivative contract, is unable or unwilling to meet its financial obligations</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>High Yield and Distressed Company Risk:</b> the risk that high yield securities and unrated securities of similar credit quality (commonly known as ""junk bonds"") and securities of distressed companies may be subject to greater levels of credit, issuer and liquidity risks. Securities of distressed companies include both debt and equity securities. High yield securities and debt securities of distressed companies are considered primarily speculative with respect to the issuer's continuing ability to make principal and interest payments. Distressed companies may be engaged in restructurings or bankruptcy proceedings</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Currency Risk:</b> the risk that foreign currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar and affect the Fund's investments in foreign (non-U.S.) currencies or in securities that trade in, and receive revenues in, or in derivatives that provide exposure to, foreign (non-U.S.) currencies</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Liquidity Risk:</b> the risk that a particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell and that the Fund may be unable to sell illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price or achieve its desired level of exposure to a certain sector</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Leveraging Risk:</b> the risk that certain transactions of the Fund, such as reverse repurchase agreements, loans of portfolio securities, and the use of when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment transactions, or derivative instruments, may give rise to leverage, causing the Fund to be more volatile than if it had not been leveraged</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Management Risk:</b> the risk that the investment techniques and risk analyses applied by PIMCO will not produce the desired results and that legislative, regulatory, or tax developments may affect the investment techniques available to PIMCO and the individual portfolio manager in connection with managing the Fund. There is no guarantee that the investment objective of the Fund will be achieved</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Small-Cap and Mid-Cap Company Risk:</b> the risk that the value of securities issued by small-capitalization and mid-capitalization companies may go up or down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably, due to narrow markets and limited managerial and financial resources</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Derivatives Risk:</b> the risk of investing in derivative instruments, including liquidity, interest rate, market, credit and management risks, mispricing or improper valuation. Changes in the value of the derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying asset, rate or index, and the Fund could lose more than the principal amount invested</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Short Sale Risk:</b> the risk of entering into short sales, including the potential loss of more money than the actual cost of the investment, and the risk that the third party to the short sale may fail to honor its contract terms, causing a loss to the Fund</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Convertible Securities Risk:</b> the risk that the market values of convertible securities tend to decline as interest rates increase and, conversely, to increase as interest rates decline. A convertible security's market value, however, tends to reflect the market price of the common stock of the issuing company when that stock price approaches or is greater than the convertible security's ""conversion price""</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Commodity Risk:</b> the risk that investing in commodity-linked derivative instruments may subject the Fund to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities. The value of commodity-linked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements, commodity index volatility, changes in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as drought, floods, weather, livestock disease, embargoes, tariffs and international economic, political and regulatory developments</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Tax Risk:</b> the risk that the tax treatment of swap agreements and other derivative instruments, such as commodity-linked derivative instruments, including commodity index-linked notes, swap agreements, commodity options, futures, and options on futures, may be affected by future regulatory or legislative changes that could affect the character, timing and/or amount of the Fund's taxable income or gains and distributions</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Subsidiary Risk:</b> the risk that, by investing in the Subsidiary, the Fund is indirectly exposed to the risks associated with the Subsidiary's investments. There is no guarantee that the investment objective of the Subsidiary will be achieved</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">Please see ""Description of Principal Risks"" in the Fund's prospectus for a more detailed description of the risks of investing in the Fund.

Strategy Narrative [Text Block],c_S000035999_AAAA,,,,,"<p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing under normal circumstances in long and short positions of equity and equity-related securities, including common and preferred stock (and securities convertible into, or that Pacific Investment Management Company LLC (""PIMCO"") expects to be exchanged for, common or preferred stock), utilizing a fundamental investing style that integrates bottom-up and top-down research. The Fund will normally invest a substantial portion of its assets in equity and equity-related securities. The Fund may also invest in fixed income securities of varying maturities, cash and cash equivalents.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund will generally take long positions in investments that PIMCO believes to be undervalued and short positions in investments that PIMCO believes to be overvalued or which are established for hedging purposes. The Fund generally will be long biased, but may take both long and short positions simultaneously. The Fund may experience high volatility in returns. The Fund is non-diversified, which means that it may invest its assets in a smaller number of issuers than a diversified fund.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The fundamental analysis that PIMCO will conduct when analyzing investments for the Fund may include some or all of the following: review of an issuer's Securities and Exchange Commission filings; interviews with an issuer's management, customers, competitors and suppliers; review of various independent sources of news, information and analysis of the issuer and its industry; preparation of prospective financial statements; and deriving an estimation of an issuer's value on both an absolute basis and relative to that of similar issuers.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">There is no limitation on the market capitalization range of the issuers in which the Fund may invest. The Fund may invest, without limitation, in securities and instruments that are economically tied to foreign (non-U.S.) countries, including securities and instruments that are economically tied to emerging market countries. The Fund may obtain foreign currency exposure (from non-U.S. dollar-denominated securities or currencies) without limitation. The debt investments of the Fund may include investment-grade securities and high yield securities (""junk bonds"") of any rating.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund may invest in derivative instruments, such as options, futures contracts, options on futures and swap agreements, consistent with its investment objective. The Fund may also invest in real estate investment trusts (""REITs""). The Fund may purchase or sell securities on a when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment basis and may regularly engage in short sales and borrowings for investment purposes. As market volatility increases, the portfolio manager may trade the Fund's portfolio more frequently. The Fund may maintain significant amounts in cash and cash equivalents, without limitation, when PIMCO determines that opportunities for investing are unattractive.</p>"

Under certain conditions, even if the value of the Fund's long positions are rising, this could be offset by declining values of the Fund's short positions. Conversely, it is possible that rising values of the Fund's short positions could be offset by declining values of the Fund's long positions. In either scenario the Fund may experience losses. In a market where the value of both the Fund's long and short positions are declining, the Fund may experience substantial losses. The principal risks of investing in the Fund, which could adversely affect its net asset value, yield and total return are:</p>

               <b>Equity Risk:</b> the risk that the value of equity securities, such as common stocks and preferred stocks, may decline due to general market conditions which are not specifically related to a particular company or to factors affecting a particular industry or industries. Equity securities generally have greater price volatility than fixed income securities</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Value Investing Risk:</b> a value stock may decrease in price or may not increase in price as anticipated by PIMCO if it continues to be undervalued by the market or the factors that PIMCO believes will cause the stock price to increase do not occur</p>

               <b>Small-Cap and Mid-Cap Company Risk:</b> the risk that the value of securities issued by small-capitalization and mid-capitalization companies may go up or down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably, due to narrow markets and limited managerial and financial resources</p>

               <b>Short Sale Risk:</b> the risk of entering into short sales, including the potential loss of more money than the actual cost of the investment, and the risk that the third party to the short sale may fail to honor its contract terms, causing a loss to the Fund</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Leveraging Risk:</b> the risk that certain transactions of the Fund, such as reverse repurchase agreements, loans of portfolio securities, and the use of when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment transactions, or derivative instruments, may give rise to leverage, causing the Fund to be more volatile than if it had not been leveraged</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Issuer Non-Diversification Risk:</b> the risk of focusing investments in a small number of issuers, including being more susceptible to risks associated with a single economic, political or regulatory occurrence than a more diversified portfolio might be. Funds that are ""non-diversified"" may invest a greater percentage of their assets in the securities of a single issuer than funds that are ""diversified""</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Management Risk:</b> the risk that the investment techniques and risk analyses applied by PIMCO will not produce the desired results and that legislative, regulatory, or tax developments may affect the investment techniques available to PIMCO and the individual portfolio manager in connection with managing the Fund. There is no guarantee that the investment objective of the Fund will be achieved</p>

               <b>Derivatives Risk:</b> the risk of investing in derivative instruments, including liquidity, interest rate, market, credit and management risks, mispricing or improper valuation. Changes in the value of the derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying asset, rate or index, and the Fund could lose more than the principal amount invested</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Liquidity Risk:</b> the risk that a particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell and that the Fund may be unable to sell illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price or achieve its desired level of exposure to a certain sector</p>

               <b>Foreign (Non-U.S.) Investment Risk:</b> the risk that investing in foreign (non-U.S.) securities may result in the Fund experiencing more rapid and extreme changes in value than a fund that invests exclusively in securities of U.S. companies, due to smaller markets, differing reporting, accounting and auditing standards, and nationalization, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, currency blockage, or political changes or diplomatic developments. Foreign securities may also be less liquid and more difficult to value than securities of U.S. issuers</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Real Estate Risk:</b> the risk that the Fund's investments in real estate investment trusts (""REITs"") or real estate-linked derivative instruments will subject the Fund to risks similar to those associated with direct ownership of real estate, including losses from casualty or condemnation, and changes in local and general economic conditions, supply and demand, interest rates, zoning laws, regulatory limitations on rents, property taxes and operating expenses. The Fund's investments in REITs or real estate-linked derivative instruments subject it to management and tax risks</p>

               <b>Interest Rate Risk:</b> the risk that fixed income securities will decline in value because of an increase in interest rates; a fund with a longer average portfolio duration will be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than a fund with a shorter average portfolio duration</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Credit Risk:</b> the risk that the Fund could lose money if the issuer or guarantor of a fixed income security, or the counterparty to a derivative contract, is unable or unwilling to meet its financial obligations</p>

               <b>High Yield and Distressed Company Risk:</b> the risk that high yield securities and unrated securities of similar credit quality (commonly known as ""junk bonds"") and securities of distressed companies may be subject to greater levels of credit, issuer and liquidity risks. Securities of distressed companies include both debt and equity securities. High yield securities and debt securities of distressed companies are considered primarily speculative with respect to the issuer's continuing ability to make principal and interest payments. Distressed companies may be engaged in restructurings or bankruptcy proceedings</p>

Performance Narrative [Text Block],c_S000035999_AAAA,,,,,"<p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The performance information shows summary performance information for the Fund in a bar chart and an Average Annual Total Returns table. The information provides some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing changes in its performance from year to year and by showing how the Fund's average annual returns compare with the returns of a broad-based securities market index. The Administrative Class and Class R of the Fund have not commenced operations as of the date of this prospectus.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">A privately offered fund managed by the Fund's portfolio manager was reorganized into the Fund and the Fund commenced operations on April 20, 2012. This privately offered fund was organized on December 1, 2002 and commenced operations on January 1, 2003 and had an investment objective and strategies that were, in all material respects, the same as those of the Fund, and was managed in a manner that, in all material respects, complied with the investment guidelines and restrictions of the Fund. However, the privately offered fund was not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ""1940 Act""), and the privately offered fund was not subject to certain investment limitations, diversification requirements, liquidity requirements, and other restrictions imposed by the 1940 Act and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which, if applicable, may have adversely affected its performance.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund's performance for periods prior to the commencement of operations on April 20, 2012 is that of the privately offered fund. The performance of the privately offered fund has not been restated to reflect the fees, expenses and fee waivers and/or expense limitations applicable to each class of shares of the Fund. If the performance of the privately offered fund had been restated to reflect the applicable fees and expenses of each class of shares of the Fund, the performance may have been higher or lower than the performance shown in the bar chart and Average Annual Total Returns table below. For periods following the Fund's commencement of operations on April 20, 2012, the performance of each class of shares differs as a result of the different levels of fees and expenses applicable to each class of shares.</p>

               <i>The Fund's past performance, before and after taxes, is not necessarily an indication of how the Fund will perform in the future</i>.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund's benchmark index is the 3 Month USD LIBOR Index. LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) is an average interest rate, determined by the British Bankers Association, that banks charge one another for the use of short-term money (3 months) in England's Eurodollar market. The privately offered fund began operations on January 1, 2003. Index comparisons began on December 31, 2002.</p>

Strategy Narrative [Text Block],c_S000028117_AAAA,,,,,"<p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing under normal circumstances in equity securities, including common and preferred stock (and securities convertible into, or that Pacific Investment Management Company LLC (""PIMCO"") expects to be exchanged for, common or preferred stock), of issuers that PIMCO believes are undervalued. The Fund's bottom-up value investment style attempts to identify securities that are undervalued by the market in comparison to PIMCO's own determination of the company's value, taking into account criteria such as asset value, book value and cash flow and earnings estimates.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">When making investments, PIMCO evaluates the merits of each investment separately and there are no specific limitations on the value, asset size, earnings or industry classification of the Fund's investments. The Fund may invest in securities issued by large-capitalization, mid-capitalization and small-capitalization companies. The Fund generally considers large- and mid-cap companies to be those with market capitalizations greater than $1.5 billion. The Fund may invest, without limitation, in securities and instruments that are economically tied to foreign (non-U.S.) countries. The Fund may also invest in securities and instruments that are economically tied to emerging market countries.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund may also invest in U.S. and non-U.S. sovereign government debt and other debt securities, including bank loans, that PIMCO selects on the basis of its determination of the security's value and not necessarily based on the coupon rate or credit rating of the security. The debt investments of the Fund may include high yield securities (""junk bonds"") of any rating. The Fund may invest in the securities of distressed companies including defaulted securities, which typically involve investments in lower-rated debt securities and loans but may also include equity securities of distressed companies.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund may invest in commodity-related investments. The Fund will seek to gain exposure to the commodity futures markets primarily through investments in the PIMCO Cayman Commodity Fund VI, Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Fund organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands (the ""Subsidiary""). The Subsidiary is advised by PIMCO, and has the same investment objective as the Fund. As discussed in greater detail elsewhere in the prospectus, the Subsidiary (unlike the Fund) may invest without limitation in commodity index-linked swap agreements and other commodity-linked derivative instruments.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund may engage in a risk arbitrage strategy to take advantage of a perceived relationship between the value of two securities. Under an arbitrage strategy, the Fund may purchase one security while selling short another security. The security purchased is generally considered by PIMCO to be undervalued relative to the price of the security sold short, or the security sold short is generally considered to be overvalued relative to the price of the security purchased. Issuers of securities acquired pursuant to an arbitrage strategy may be engaged in certain types of corporate events, such as restructurings, acquisitions, mergers, takeovers, tender or exchange offers or liquidations. The Fund may attempt to hedge foreign currency exposure using foreign currency exchange contracts and other investments and may utilize derivative instruments to hedge against other market risks. The Fund may also invest in derivative instruments, such as options, futures contracts or swap agreements consistent with its investment objective. The Fund may purchase or sell securities on a when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment basis and may engage in short sales. The Fund may also enter into reverse repurchase agreements and lend portfolio securities.</p>
            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">The Fund may purchase securities to seek to influence or control management of an issuer, or may invest in other companies that do so, when the portfolio managers believe such actions would benefit the Fund.</p>"

               <b>Equity Risk:</b> the risk that the value of equity securities, such as common stocks and preferred stocks, may decline due to general market conditions which are not specifically related to a particular company or to factors affecting a particular industry or industries. Equity securities generally have greater price volatility than fixed income securities</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Value Investing Risk:</b> a value stock may decrease in price or may not increase in price as anticipated by PIMCO if it continues to be undervalued by the market or the factors that PIMCO believes will cause the stock price to increase do not occur</p>

               <b>Foreign (Non-U.S.) Investment Risk:</b> the risk that investing in foreign (non-U.S.) securities may result in the Fund experiencing more rapid and extreme changes in value than a fund that invests exclusively in securities of U.S. companies, due to smaller markets, differing reporting, accounting and auditing standards, increased risk of delayed settlement of portfolio transactions or loss of certificates of portfolio securities, and the risk of unfavorable foreign government actions, including nationalization, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, currency blockage, or political changes or diplomatic developments. Foreign securities may also be less liquid and more difficult to value than securities of U.S. issuers</p>

               <b>Issuer Risk:</b> the risk that the value of a security may decline for reasons directly related to the issuer, such as management performance, financial leverage and reduced demand for the issuer's goods or services</p>

               <b>Interest Rate Risk:</b> the risk that fixed income securities will decline in value because of an increase in interest rates; a fund with a longer average portfolio duration will be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than a fund with a shorter average portfolio duration</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Credit Risk:</b> the risk that the Fund could lose money if the issuer or guarantor of a fixed income security, or the counterparty to a derivative contract, is unable or unwilling to meet its financial obligations</p>

               <b>High Yield and Distressed Company Risk:</b> the risk that high yield securities and unrated securities of similar credit quality (commonly known as ""junk bonds"") and securities of distressed companies may be subject to greater levels of credit, issuer and liquidity risks. Securities of distressed companies include both debt and equity securities. High yield securities and debt securities of distressed companies are considered primarily speculative with respect to the issuer's continuing ability to make principal and interest payments. Distressed companies may be engaged in restructurings or bankruptcy proceedings</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Currency Risk:</b> the risk that foreign currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar and affect the Fund's investments in foreign (non-U.S.) currencies or in securities that trade in, and receive revenues in, or in derivatives that provide exposure to, foreign (non-U.S.) currencies</p>

            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Leveraging Risk:</b> the risk that certain transactions of the Fund, such as reverse repurchase agreements, loans of portfolio securities, and the use of when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment transactions, or derivative instruments, may give rise to leverage, causing the Fund to be more volatile than if it had not been leveraged</p>

            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Short Sale Risk:</b> the risk of entering into short sales, including the potential loss of more money than the actual cost of the investment, and the risk that the third party to the short sale may fail to honor its contract terms, causing a loss to the Fund</p>


            <p style=""font-size:12;padding-top:2;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;"">
               <b>Commodity Risk:</b> the risk that investing in commodity-linked derivative instruments may subject the Fund to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities. The value of commodity-linked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements, commodity index volatility, changes in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as drought, floods, weather, livestock disease, embargoes, tariffs and international economic, political and regulatory developments</p>

Performance for Class A and Class C shares in the Average Annual Total Returns table reflects the impact of sales charges. The Administrative Class of the Fund has not commenced operations as of the date of this prospectus. <i>The Fund's past performance, before and after taxes, is not necessarily an indication of how the Fund will perform in the future</i>.</p>
